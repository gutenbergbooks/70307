 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">ou</span> have kept your appointment,
Monsieur—that is well,’ said Mrs.
Belassis, in her measured tones.
‘I am convinced that we ought to understand
one another, that we have the same object
in view. It would facilitate matters if
you would speak out more frankly, and
tell me what is the real object of your visit
here.’</p>

<p>‘I came to see Mr. Meredith,’ answered the
Italian, with irritating caution.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis would not allow her impatience
to betray itself.</p>

<p>‘Ostensibly, yes; but you know, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
know, that your real motive was to watch
Philip Debenham.’</p>

<p>The stranger smiled significantly.</p>

<p>‘To watch the present master of Ladywell—Madame
is right.’</p>

<p>‘And the motive of this watching is, I presume,
not friendship for him?’</p>

<p>The answer did not come so readily as
she had expected, and it was still ambiguous.</p>

<p>‘Not friendship—not enmity—simple curiosity.’</p>

<p>‘Simple curiosity!’ repeated Mrs. Belassis;
‘that is rather hard to believe. Monsieur,
you know you had a deeper motive than that.
You have admitted as much on two other occasions.
You know that a great injustice is
being done.’</p>

<p>‘Madame may be right; but on what
grounds does she bring so great an accusation
against her kinsman?’</p>

<p>‘Kinsman!’ she echoed wrathfully; ‘I
claim no kin with him. He is a traitor, a
false friend, a treacherous foe. I wash my
hands of him altogether. He has behaved
villainously to me and mine; I would ruin
him gladly if I could, and so would you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>The Italian looked steadily into her flushed
face.</p>

<p>‘I am not sure,’ he said slowly, ‘if I
would.’</p>

<p>‘You would if you were a man,’ she said
with some scorn. ‘Think of the wrongs your
friend is enduring!’</p>

<p>‘What friend?’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Torwood. Have you forgotten our
conversation of only a few days back? You
know better than I do what the wrong is; but
I know enough.’</p>

<p>‘What does Madame know?’</p>

<p>‘I know that he is keeping his friend
hidden away somewhere, in a kind of captivity
(unless he has escaped, as I believe you
assured me he had), that he has gained possession
of his money and the management of
his affairs. I have seen with my own eyes
that he is spending Mr. Torwood’s money as
lavishly as his own. He is behaving scandalously,
there can be no doubt whatever of that.
If you are a friend of the injured man’s, can
you not do something to put a stop to it?’</p>

<p>‘Why does not Mr. Torwood act for himself?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>‘How can I tell? Most likely he cannot.
<i>His friend</i> has contrived to settle that point
satisfactorily. He may be in a madhouse, for
aught I know.’</p>

<p>‘Madame does not <i>know</i> anything, then?’</p>

<p>‘No, no facts; but I know quite well that
evil is going on, and I mean to check it.
Monsieur, will you not help me? If you will
but tell me what you know, I will be the one
to act; I will relieve you of all the burden of
responsibility.’</p>

<p>‘What does Madame wish to know?’</p>

<p>‘I wish to know where Mr. Torwood is.’</p>

<p>‘He is not far away from here.’</p>

<p>‘You mean he is in England?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, certainly.’</p>

<p>‘And near this place?’</p>

<p>‘Quite near.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked eager and triumphant.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur is not jesting?’</p>

<p>‘By no means. I do but speak the
truth.’</p>

<p>‘Can he be at Ladywell—in the village?’</p>

<p>‘Madame is right. He is at Ladywell; he
has been there for some time.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis stared at him.</p>

<p>‘At Ladywell? And I have never seen
him!’</p>

<p>The Italian smiled significantly.</p>

<p>‘I never said Madame had not seen
him.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis began to grow excited.</p>

<p>‘Signor Pagliadini, are <i>you</i> Mr. Torwood?’</p>

<p>He shook his head, and she looked disappointed.</p>

<p>‘I have not that honour.’</p>

<p>‘Where, and who is he, then? Monsieur,
I entreat you, introduce me to your friend.’</p>

<p>‘Madame needs no introduction. Madame
is already well acquainted.’</p>

<p>A long silence ensued. Mrs. Belassis’ face
had grown dark. She seemed half afraid to
offer another suggestion.</p>

<p>‘You must tell me more, Monsieur.’</p>

<p>But the eager look on the Italian’s face had
given place to one of hesitation. He looked
like a man who has been led on to say more
than he at first intended.</p>

<p>‘I have said enough,’ he answered quickly;
‘Madame must not misunderstand me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>‘I begin to think I understand at last.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis spoke very slowly, as if her
mind was full of thought—too full to admit
of free speech. She pressed her hand to her
head, and her eyes seemed to darken and deepen.</p>

<p>‘Oh, if <i>that</i> is it, what a villain, a scoundrel
he has been! But the law will lay a hand
upon him. He shall not be allowed to
escape.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ asked the Italian,
who looked somewhat uneasy.</p>

<p>‘I mean, Monsieur, that you have let out
your secret at last. I know now who and
where Mr. Torwood is. Ah! why did I not
think of it when Sir Herbert Moncrieff identified
him as Torwood—when we all said how
utterly unlike any Debenham he was? How
could he? How dared he? But he has
reached the end of his tether. Now it is my
turn.’</p>

<p>The Signor moved restlessly. He looked
half interested, half annoyed. He seemed
eager, yet reluctant, to speak.</p>

<p>‘Madame must be careful and secret. Mr.
Torwood is a good friend, but a dangerous
enemy.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis pondered over this.</p>

<p>‘Where is Mr. Debenham?’ she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>‘At sea—on a sea-voyage for his health.’</p>

<p>‘Does he know of this? Can he have given
Mr. Torwood powers to act?’</p>

<p>‘He has not done so. He is too ill to know
anything about it.’</p>

<p>‘Could he not be brought back? He
should prosecute at once.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps he would decline to prosecute his
friend.’</p>

<p>‘Friend!’ repeated Mrs. Belassis venomously.
Then she added, with an evil look,
‘We are Philip Debenham’s next-of-kin. <i>We</i>
will prosecute.’</p>

<p>Her eyes glowed with malicious triumph.
She spoke with a relish that was malignant.</p>

<p>‘Forgery, fraud, false pretences, gross
treachery and wholesale robbery—a very nice
list against an English gentleman of honourable
name. Yes, Philip Debenham; a little
quiet conversation with me will open your
eyes considerably. You will not look so bold
at the close, as you do at the commencement of
our interview.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>But Signor Pagliadini did not seem inclined
to allow the matter to slip thus out of his own
hands.</p>

<p>‘Madame is very confident; but it seems to
me that she is too much so. Mr. Torwood is
a clever man. Most likely he knows what he
is about, and will be quite ready to meet and
to fight Madame. Victory is not always to
the righteous. It is generally to the strong.
Does not your proverb say that possession is
nine points of the law?’</p>

<p>‘You mean he would dispute the possession?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis seemed to pause and reflect.
That was a new and unwelcome idea. She
even wondered if the Italian could by any
chance have tried to put her upon a wrong
tack, for he was anything but open with
her.</p>

<p>Torrington Torwood—Philip Debenham; the
names seemed to float as in a mist before her,
and she could not disentangle the one from
the other. She was convinced one moment
that the present master of Ladywell <i>must</i> be
Philip Debenham—he could not otherwise
assume such mastery; and surely no one else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
would dare to play the part he was playing: it
would be too reckless, too dangerous. And
yet a host of small doubts and suspicions
crowded upon her, one after the other, all
pointing to the strange conclusion that the
man was an impostor, not Philip Debenham at
all, but merely someone who understood his
affairs as well as he did himself—in other words,
Torrington Torwood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis’ head seemed fairly to swim.
If only the Italian would speak out and ratify
in actual words the hints he had thrown out.
His manner was so odd that she found herself
inclined to doubt even such statements as he
had made. What if he were an enemy too,
leading her on to worse troubles than already
beset her path?</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis was thoroughly uncomfortable,
devoured by curiosity and uncertainty, yet too
distrustful of her companion to press him with
further inquiries.</p>

<p>She made one last attempt to draw him
out.</p>

<p>‘Whether or not he is the right man, I am
convinced that he will retain the place he has
gained, be it by fair means or foul. He has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
strength, wealth, determination, and this three
months has enabled him to settle himself
firmly in possession. Philip Debenham had
better look to himself when he returns from
sea. This man has all the property, and will
take care that he keeps it. He will dispute
the possession by every weapon in his power,
and he will win.’</p>

<p>The Signor looked uneasy.</p>

<p>‘You think that?’</p>

<p>‘I am convinced of it. I have studied his
character closely. He is proud, and he is unscrupulous.
He will never submit to be
humiliated. He will fight to the death. It is
might, not right, that conquers in such a
struggle, and he has the power.’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini looked irresolute, like
a man who half wishes, half fears to
speak.</p>

<p>‘Then you would not prosecute?’</p>

<p>‘I should have to think seriously before I
did so. My husband would be swayed in the
matter by me. If we were absolutely convinced
of our cause, we might be inclined to
do so; much would depend upon the character
and appearance of Philip Debenham when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
appeared. We could not act unless the
whole case were frankly confided to us.’</p>

<p>She paused, but the Italian did not seem
inclined to speak, so she added impressively:</p>

<p>‘If you are concerned in this matter, Monsieur,
and have the interests of your friend
really at heart, you cannot do better than confide
in me. I am anxious that justice should
be done; but I cannot act in the dark. Have
you nothing more to tell me?’</p>

<p>There was a little hesitation before the
answer came; but it was quite decided
then.</p>

<p>‘No, Madame; nothing more, I thank
you.’</p>

<p>‘I hope you may not regret your decision
when it is too late,’ said Mrs. Belassis loftily,
as she rose and turned away. ‘Good-morning,
Monsieur.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis walked home in a state of
mind bordering on distraction. She would
have given anything in the world to have been
absolutely certain that this supposed nephew
of hers was an impostor. She hated him so
cordially, that no trouble would be too great to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
compass his ruin, if only she could be sure of
her position.</p>

<p>She had many grounds of suspicion; many
incidents rose to her mind, all pointing to the
desired conclusion, and the Italian had certainly
told her that Torwood was at Ladywell,
and Philip Debenham at sea. But then came
maddening doubts of the stranger’s truthfulness;
and it would be too humiliating to set
on foot a charge which could not be substantiated,
especially such a serious one as
this.</p>

<p>She reached home in a restless and perturbed
state, and found that a cloud seemed to
hang over the atmosphere of Thornton House.
Bertha was pouting and kicking the leg of her
chair, and Matilda’s eyes looked as if they had
been shedding tears. Her face was angry and
discontented.</p>

<p>‘Is anything the matter?’ asked Mrs.
Belassis, as she took her seat at the luncheon-table.</p>

<p>Neither her husband nor her son were
present, and the three ladies had the room to
themselves.</p>

<p>‘Nothing particular. I don’t suppose you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
will care. You never do care for our interests,
Matilda’s or mine. Only Phil’s engaged to be
married.’</p>

<p>‘Philip engaged! To whom, pray?’</p>

<p>‘To Roma Meredith, of all people in the
world! We met old Mr. Meredith out driving,
and he told us. It is a shame! There’s
nothing whatever in her to make him care for
her. It’s only because she’s had such
chances.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis made no reply. She fancied
she might make capital out of what she had
just heard. She was convinced that the Italian
was in love with Roma, and jealousy is a
powerful incentive to revenge.</p>

<p>‘It is too bad!’ cried Matilda, with a half-sob.
‘And Phil was so nice and kind and
attentive when he first came, and was always
quite friendly until people made it so horrid
for him that he couldn’t come any more. I
do call it too bad!’</p>

<p>‘So do I,’ rejoined Bertha. ‘It’s a great
shame. I’m sure we had as good a chance as
anyone, until mamma spoilt it by being so
disagreeable to him.’</p>

<p>Anger and disappointment robbed the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
girls of their customary dread of their
mother.</p>

<p>‘The best match in the county,’ grumbled
Matilda. ‘And we might have taken our
chance with anyone, if we’d only had fair
play.’</p>

<p>‘Mamma, how can you sit there smiling in
that aggravating way?’ burst out Bertha
spitefully. ‘You know it’s your fault.
You’ve always set yourself against our interests.
I call it dreadful for anyone’s mother
to be so unkind. And now you don’t seem to
care one bit!’</p>

<p>‘What should I care about, pray? Do be
more explicit and less violent.’</p>

<p>Bertha turned away angrily.</p>

<p>Matilda answered sulkily enough:</p>

<p>‘One of us might have married him, if we’d
had a fair chance.’</p>

<p>‘A good thing for you you have not; he is
no fit match for one of my daughters.’</p>

<p>‘Mamma! What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘I mean that I shall look higher for you
than that—cousin of yours.’</p>

<p>‘Mamma! He is master of Ladywell!’</p>

<p>‘<i>Is</i> he master of Ladywell?’ responded Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Belassis, with more spitefulness than caution.
‘That remains to be proved.’</p>

<p>‘Mamma! What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘That I hardly know. I have been hearing
a very curious story to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, what? Do tell us? About Phil?’</p>

<p>‘Well, to speak more accurately, I should
say about the man we have called Phil all this
time.’</p>

<p>Bertha’s eyes were bright with excitement.</p>

<p>‘Oh, then there is a mystery after all! I
always did think there was something odd
about Phil, ever since Sir Herbert Moncrieff
was so surprised that he was Mr. Debenham,
not Mr. Torwood.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked at her.</p>

<p>‘You suspected something odd then?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; what Sir Herbert said afterwards, when
he saw Maud, was so funny. I didn’t mean to
tell anyone, and I promised Phil I wouldn’t;
but if he’s going to marry Roma, I don’t care
about keeping his secret any longer.’</p>

<p>‘Speak out, child. What secret? Did he
confide in you, and ask you to keep quiet?
Just explain yourself,’ said Mrs. Belassis impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>‘I will, if you’ll only give me time.’</p>

<p>Bertha, who liked to be important, was
delighted to be able to impart anything so interesting
to her mother.</p>

<p>‘You heard how Sir Herbert greeted Phil
as Mr. Torwood, and how surprised he was
when Phil told him his name was Debenham?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes; go on.’</p>

<p>‘Well, when we were walking about the
gardens together, and he saw Maud, he knew
directly who she was, because he said she was
so exactly like the Philip Debenham he had
met in America. When he remembered that
Tor had just said <i>he</i> was Philip Debenham he
got a little confused, and evidently didn’t
quite know what to say. However, I didn’t
pretend to notice particularly what he had
said, and we dropped the subject. But I didn’t
forget it, and I told Phil about it one day soon
afterwards.’</p>

<p>‘Did you? What did he say? Was he
put out?’ asked Mrs. Belassis eagerly.</p>

<p>‘No, not at all; at least, he didn’t seem so.
He didn’t seem to care a bit; and he laughed
when I promised to say nothing about it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
didn’t appear to mind at all. He made me
think very little of it myself.’</p>

<p>‘That was his cunning,’ said Mrs. Belassis
viciously. ‘It is quite in keeping with his cool
audacity and daring all throughout. Bertha,
your evidence is of the greatest value at such
a juncture. It is proof positive of the suspicion
I have been puzzling over for an hour
or more.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! what, mamma? Do tell us!’ urged
Matilda.</p>

<p>‘I believe I know!’ cried Bertha, whose
wits were the quickest. ‘Phil is not Phil at
all, but Mr. Torwood; and he has been pretending
all the while to be Phil. Isn’t that
it, mamma?’</p>

<p>‘That is what I strongly suspect,’ said Mrs.
Belassis, with more of her usual deliberation;
‘but girls, no word of this is to be breathed
until I give you leave. A gross wrong has
been committed, and a heartless fraud perpetrated.
We, as Philip Debenham’s next-of-kin,
cannot suffer things to go on unexposed
and unpunished; but we shall defeat our
own ends if we go to work rashly, or show
our hand too soon. You must be silent as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
the grave until the time comes for the exposure.’</p>

<p>The girls looked excited.</p>

<p>‘But what will happen, mamma? Will Phil
be sent to prison?’</p>

<p>‘I should hope so. I should expect a heavy
sentence for so deliberate and treacherous a
crime. The penalty for forgery is a heavy
one.’</p>

<p>A few days—nay, a few hours back, Matilda
and Bertha would have been filled with compassion
for the unhappy criminal. Now,
however, their feelings had undergone a revolution,
and their interest in him had dwindled
to a mere shadow. The excitement of a crime
and prosecution far outweighed any feeling of
commiseration for the victim.</p>

<p>‘Oh, mamma, how dreadful! Will there
be a trial? Shall we have to be witnesses?
What will Phil look like? Oh, how wicked
he must be!’</p>

<p>‘And then there will be another Phil to
come here!’ cried Matilda, with animation.
‘Another Phil ten times as nice as this one, I
dare say. I wonder what he will be like, and
what he will say to it all. Mamma, where is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the real Phil? Why didn’t he come? Why
did he let Mr. Torwood go on so?’</p>

<p>‘I believe he has been very ill, and entirely
in Mr. Torwood’s power. I do not yet know
exactly where he is, or what is the matter with
him; but I shall find out all in due time, no
doubt. It is evident that he has not been a
free agent during this crisis; and now he has
been sent on a sea-voyage to get him still
farther out of the way, whilst Mr. Torwood
strengthens himself more and more in his
position. I shall make every effort to find
Philip, and bring him over here. When we once
have the true heir in our keeping, the false one
must abdicate. Maud’s likeness to her brother
will prove of inestimable value.’</p>

<p>‘And Maud is so fond of that dreadful Mr.
Torwood,’ said Matilda. ‘Whatever <i>will</i> she
say!’</p>

<p>‘It has been the most disgraceful affair from
first to last,’ said Mrs. Belassis, with righteous
indignation; ‘but it shall soon be brought to
an ignominious conclusion.’</p>

<p>‘And Phil, the real Phil, will be so fond of
us!’ cried Bertha eagerly. ‘He will be so
grateful to mamma—and to me too—for having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
found it all out; and to papa and mamma for
bringing him back, and helping him against
that wicked man he thought was his friend!
Oh, it will all be so different and so nice!
There will be no more quarrels now. Phil
will quite seem to belong to us; and I’m sure
he will always feel that he can never be grateful
enough, or do enough for us, for doing so
much for him. It will be altogether delightful!’</p>

<p>This was an eminently pleasing view of the
matter, and the sisters became enthusiastic.</p>

<p>‘Oh, mamma, how long will it be before
something happens? Please tell us what you
are going to do!’</p>

<p>‘My first step,’ said Mrs. Belassis deliberately,
‘will be to have an interview with this
man who calls himself Philip Debenham. After
that, I shall know better on what ground we
stand.’</p>

<small>THE ATTACK.</small></h2>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/i_ha.jpg" alt="‘H" /></div>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">ave</span> you ever examined the securities
of Maud’s trust-money?’ asked
Miss Marjory of Tor. ‘Do you
know how it is invested, or what interest has
been accumulating? The interest, even of
the five thousand only, will have mounted up
in eighteen years. Have you ever made inquiries
into the question?’</p>

<p>‘I have made a few inquiries; but I have
not elicited much information. Mr. Belassis—as
guardian, trustee, and executor—has had
full power over the money all this time, and
has seen fit to resent any kind of questioning
from me.’</p>

<p>‘That looks bad,’ said Miss Marjory. ‘That
man is a rogue, Philip.’</p>

<p>‘I am aware of it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>‘A pretty sort of trustee! How could Mr.
Debenham have trusted him?’</p>

<p>‘I believe he did not do so. I believe he
made a later will. I believe this one was a
mere blind——’</p>

<p>‘A later will!’ cried Miss Marjory exultantly.
‘Why, of course he did—that would explain
it all. I could not conceive how a sane
man——But where <i>is</i> the later will, then?
Why is it not produced? Why does this one
stand?’</p>

<p>Tor shook his head.</p>

<p>‘We are afraid it fell into the hands of
Belassis, as the mass of papers did. You know
as well as I, what its fate would be then.’</p>

<p>‘You think he has destroyed it?’</p>

<p>‘I do.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory paused, with her head on one
side. By-and-by she said:</p>

<p>‘So do not I.’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘Because he is so unequivocally anxious for
Maud’s marriage with his son. Maud would
only bring in a dowry of five thousand, as
matters stand now—a mere pittance for a
young lady of refined and expensive tastes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
But if he suspects the existence of a later will,
his anxiety is explained. When Maud is his
son’s wife, he could snap his fingers at any
discovery.’</p>

<p>Tor’s eyes brightened.</p>

<p>‘There is a great deal in what you say,
Miss Marjory. I have not been blind to the
strangeness of Mr. Belassis’ eagerness for the
marriage. I taxed him with it once, and
asked point-blank for his motive. You may
guess whether he told it.’</p>

<p>‘We must find that will!’ cried Miss
Marjory, with energy. ‘It must be hidden
away somewhere. But where can it be?’</p>

<p>‘I am much afraid it must have perished.
The house Mr. Debenham lived in has been
pulled down and rebuilt, and the furniture
sold. You may be sure Belassis would have
made an exhaustive search, if his suspicions
had been excited, as is likely enough.’</p>

<p>‘If his were not, his wife’s would be,’ said
Miss Marjory decidedly. ‘Those two Belassis’,
husband and wife, are as big a pair of knaves
as ever walked the earth.’</p>

<p>The door opened, and the servant announced:
‘Mrs. Belassis.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>‘Talk of——’ began Miss Marjory.</p>

<p>‘Show her in,’ said Tor aloud; adding, in a
low voice, ‘What can she have come for?’</p>

<p>‘Mischief,’ answered Miss Marjory, her eyes
sparkling. ‘May I stay?’</p>

<p>‘By all means.’</p>

<p>‘If she is too disagreeable. I shall put in my
word. I can silence her if needful.’</p>

<p>There was no time for more, for Mrs.
Belassis was at the door.</p>

<p>Tor rose to receive her; but his greeting
was somewhat cold. After their last passage-at-arms,
Mrs. Belassis had not disguised her
unfriendly feelings.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory merely bowed slightly; and
the keen brightness and alertness of her gaze
did not altogether please the visitor.</p>

<p>‘I have come to see you on business,’
said she, as she seated herself and looked at
Tor.</p>

<p>‘I shall be happy to give your business all
possible consideration,’ he answered politely.</p>

<p>‘It is not <i>my</i> business,’ said Mrs. Belassis,
with significance. ‘But it is of a private
nature;’ and here she looked at Miss Marjory,
who did not stir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>‘Does the privacy of its nature concern you
or me?’ questioned Tor.</p>

<p>‘You, of course. Do you imagine I should
discuss my private affairs with <i>you</i>?’</p>

<p>‘And yet,’ remarked Tor, with a smile, ‘you
expect me, it would seem, to discuss my private
affairs with you.’</p>

<p>‘I shall give you no option,’ said Mrs.
Belassis, with acrimony; ‘but remember they
are private.’</p>

<p>Again she looked at Miss Marjory, who
merely smiled, not altogether without malice.</p>

<p>‘I have a taste for dabbling in other people’s
private affairs,’ she said audaciously. ‘I think
you would be surprised if you knew some of the
things I know about the lives of people almost
unknown to me.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis made no reply, but felt vaguely
uneasy. Tor said quietly:</p>

<p>‘Miss Marjory Descartes is my very good
friend. If what you have to say relates only
to me and my affairs, she is welcome to
hear it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well,’ answered Mrs. Belassis
viciously. ‘If you have no sense of shame
yourself, I’m sure I do not wish to spare you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
All the world may know what I know, for
aught I care. Indeed, they soon will do, and
you will see then how far your precious popularity
will carry you. You will find yourself
in a felon’s dock before the next assize is over,
if you do not play a very different game from
the one you are doing now.’</p>

<p>Tor listened with a coolness which was a
little disconcerting to the excited woman
before him. Forewarned was forearmed in his
case, and he evinced nothing but an amused
incredulity in face or voice.</p>

<p>‘Indeed! this is most interesting. I had
no idea such greatness loomed before me. Pray
go on; it is like a chapter from Wilkie Collins.
Isn’t it exciting, Miss Marjory?’</p>

<p>‘Very. It always amuses me to see people
make egregious blunders,’ answered Miss Marjory
affably. ‘I hope Mrs. Belassis has a
great deal more to tell us.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis felt her face grow pale with
rage. She had never before had any statement
of hers treated with anything so like
ridicule.</p>

<p>‘I have a good deal more to tell you,’ she
answered, with suppressed savageness; ‘and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
you may thank me for great consideration that
you hear it first through me, and not through
a lawyer.’</p>

<p>‘I am ready to thank you even for a fancied
consideration,’ answered Tor quietly; ‘but let
me tell you that I would much rather hear
anything you may have to say from a lawyer
than from you. I know how to deal with a
man, and with a libel; but to a lady and a
relative, and in my own house, it is difficult
to find any suitable reply to whatever charges
she may see fit to bring.’</p>

<p>‘I am not a relative; and you are not in
your own house—you know that as well as I.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory lifted her eyebrows, shrugged
her shoulders, and smiled a smile that was
truly exasperating, as she glanced at Tor. The
look said as plainly as words could do, ‘Is she
mad?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis, strong though she felt her
cause, began to wish she had waited for a few
proofs before making an attack. The ground
under her feet was not secure enough to
warrant an encounter with two such foes as
she now saw before her.</p>

<p>‘I am quite ready to repudiate our relationship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
now that I find it is as unwelcome to
you as it is to me,’ said Tor coolly; ‘but I
repeat once more, that in my own house I
cannot answer in fitting terms a lady who
chooses to insult me. If it is all the same to
you, Mrs. Belassis, I would rather you let me
hear whatever you have to say through your
husband, or through a lawyer. If you have
any charge to bring against me, as your words
seem to imply, you had better have your case
made out in the usual way.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis knew that as matters stood at
present she had no case; and the cool scorn of
her adversary’s tone stung her to the quick.
She <i>knew</i> he was an impostor, yet she had no
real evidence to bring forward. But she was
not going to be silenced so easily.</p>

<p>‘I shall act as I choose, and speak as I
choose, and when I choose,’ she answered
angrily. ‘Bold and wicked as you are, I have
my hand on the clue which will in the end
bring shame and ruin upon you. Where is
<i>your friend</i>, Torrington Torwood?’</p>

<p>‘At sea, on a voyage for his health.’</p>

<p>‘He is not. He is in England. He is at
Ladywell. He is in this very house?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>‘Indeed! If you are so well informed as to
my friend’s movements, why come to me?’</p>

<p>‘Your friend!’ she echoed scornfully;
‘friend, indeed! Why do you even try to
keep up the deception when all is known?
You are Torrington Torwood yourself!’</p>

<p>‘How very interesting! Well, I have
played the part often enough to feel quite at
home in it. Produce your “Philip Debenham,”
and I will gladly abdicate in his favour.
It will not be the first time we have changed
names and situations.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis grew more and more excited.
It is very aggravating when we know we have
got hold of the truth, not to have power to
make it recognised and admitted by others.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to say that you are prepared
to <i>swear</i>,’ she began, with great emphasis—‘to
swear that you are Philip Debenham?’</p>

<p>‘I am prepared to swear a good deal in the
right place and at the right time,’ answered
Tor, with a steady look at Mrs. Belassis out of
his great grey eyes, which was not agreeable
to her. ‘But to you I shall certainly decline
to swear anything at all. You have thought
fit to accuse and insult me in my own house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
being fully aware that under the circumstances
you could do so with impunity. You have,
however, reached the extreme limit; and for
your own sake I should advise you to be content
with the answers you have already received.
As I have said before, if you have
any charge against me, you had better send
it through the right channel—that of the law.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory nodded her head approvingly;
she admired Tor’s high-handed way of carrying
things, and could see that it quite took his
enemy by surprise, and disquieted her somewhat;
at the same time, she thought a little
more diplomatic questioning would have been
advisable before a declaration of open defiance
had been made. They were quite ignorant as
to the strength of the adversary’s cause, and it
was hardly politic, perhaps, to court the intervention
of the law, although it was probably,
in the present position of affairs, something of
an idle threat.</p>

<p>She was not altogether sorry that at this
crisis of the conversation, Tor was called suddenly
away. He was not sorry, neither was
Mrs. Belassis, for the interruption. She had
no intention of leaving without another attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
to elicit the truth, bringing forward at
the same time her evidence, such as it was,
which would most likely produce some effect;
and she was glad of a pause, which would
enable her to think over what she meant to
say.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory, however, did not leave her
long in peace. The door had hardly closed
behind Tor before she began briskly:</p>

<p>‘Really, Mrs. Belassis, I am intensely interested
in all you say. It is quite like a
romance, this doubt you have cast upon my
friend’s identity. Do tell me some more.
What can have made you think such a
thing?’</p>

<p>‘Everybody can see that this man is not a
Debenham, and people who met him abroad
all know him as Torwood. Signor Pagliadini,
though not willing to take an active share in
the accusation, knows perfectly well that this
man is Torwood, and that Philip Debenham
is at sea. And, moreover, the real Philip
Debenham is strikingly like Maud, who has,
as you see, no resemblance at all to this impostor.’</p>

<p>‘Really, how very interesting! You surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
me. That point about the likeness is
very remarkable. You are perhaps aware that
I was intimately acquainted with Mr. Torwood’s
father; and when I happened to see a
photograph of Mr. Debenham’s friend, I was
much struck by the very strong likeness it
bore to Guy Torwood, whom I once knew so
well. Curious how likenesses strike different
persons, is it not? Signor Pagliadini thinks
him like Maud. I think him like my old
friend. Odd, is it not? There is no accounting
for such things.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked floored. Miss Marjory
spoke so easily and naturally that it was hard
to imagine she was playing a part; yet, if
what she said was true, one great fraction of
her evidence was all but demolished.</p>

<p>‘You knew—Mr. Torwood’s father,’ she
stammered. ‘And the photograph this—this
man showed you, as Mr. Torwood’s, was like
his father?’</p>

<p>‘Strikingly so. I recognised it at once from
its likeness. I must see now if I can trace in
it any likeness to Maud.’</p>

<p>‘Sir Herbert Moncrieff, who met Maud at a
party, was much struck by it; and he called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
this Philip Debenham, Torwood,’ said Mrs.
Belassis.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory seemed to consider.</p>

<p>‘Well, Mrs. Belassis, the whole question
seems rather a puzzling one; but I cannot think
it likely, from what I know of our friend, that
he would run his head into a noose for nothing.
In all probability things are as he says; but,
if not, you may be quite sure he is acting as
his friend’s agent, with his friend’s consent—probably
at his request. Those two men have
been devoted friends for eighteen years—is it
likely one would suddenly take a mania—for
robbing and defrauding the other? Whatever
is being done is, you may be certain, done by
mutual agreement; and you would find yourself
in a very awkward position if you took my
young friend’s hint, and went to law, only to
find yourself the laughing-stock of the nephew,
whose cause you thought you were promoting.
I believe, too, that no one could prosecute but
the injured party. I leave you to judge
whether this is probable.’</p>

<p>But Mrs. Belassis, though somewhat taken
aback, was not to be so easily suppressed.</p>

<p>‘My nephew is ill, and unable to act for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
himself. I have reason to believe that his
mind is temporarily affected. He is quite in
his friend’s power, and most unscrupulous use
is being made of this power. We, as next-of-kin,
are bound to protect him, and we will
do so at all risk. Let Torrington Torwood
look to himself!’ the last words were added
with such animus that Miss Marjory’s lip
curled.</p>

<p>‘You are very generous, certainly, towards
this mythical nephew of yours, whose existence
you have presupposed. Do you not think
you are actuated in reality by your curious
and incomprehensible dislike to—my Mr.
Debenham? If so, you may soon find yourself
in a very awkward position.’</p>

<p>‘Incomprehensible!’ echoed Mrs. Belassis.
‘He has done nothing but insult and oppose
us ever since he came back. He has a smooth
tongue, but he is our enemy at heart, and he
will do us an ill-turn when he can. He knows
that, and I believe you know it too.’</p>

<p>‘I do not know it. What I do know is that
he has been wonderfully considerate towards
you; and although he is acquainted with facts
which must seriously affect your peace of mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
and might bring you the greatest unhappiness
a woman can suffer, he has refrained from
letting fall one syllable which could injure you,
in spite of all the provocation you have given
him. I advise you, however, not to go too
far. A man’s patience is not supposed to be
a very elastic article. If you do not take care,
you may find the tables turned upon yourself.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked uneasy.</p>

<p>‘What can you know about my affairs?
Has this Philip, as he calls himself, told you
more than he tells me?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps he has; but in this instance it was
I who told him.’</p>

<p>‘What did you tell him?’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory looked at her without answering.</p>

<p>‘What did you tell him?’ repeated Mrs.
Belassis.</p>

<p>‘Do you really wish to know? It will not
be pleasant news.’</p>

<p>‘I do wish to know.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose you are not aware that your
husband was married in 1843?’</p>

<p>‘Married!’ gasped Mrs. Belassis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>‘Married, in Whitbury Minster, to a girl
named Nelly Roberts, who had been in my
service as lady’s-maid. He deserted her two
months after the marriage, and, so far as I
know, never heard of her again.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis sat like one turned to stone.</p>

<p>‘What became of her?’ she asked, when she
could find voice.</p>

<p>‘She lived for some time in Whitbury, and
then her health failed, and she went away.
Eventually she died; but I lost sight of her
before then.’</p>

<p>‘When did she die?’</p>

<p>‘Not long after February, 1850; but I do
not know the exact date.’</p>

<p>‘I was married in the May of that year,’
said Mrs. Belassis.</p>

<p>‘I know; and I hope—I hope—at any rate,
inquiries are being made, and we shall soon
learn the truth; but I do not for a moment
believe your husband knows anything about
the matter. I believe he lost sight of her
utterly.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis said nothing for awhile. Then
she asked:</p>

<p>‘My nephew knows this?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>‘He does.’</p>

<p>‘Why did he not tell me?’</p>

<p>‘I believe he wished to spare you.’</p>

<p>‘Then why do you tell me now?’</p>

<p>‘Because I wish to warn you. It seems to
me that you are taking a very unwise course;
and I think it fair you should know to what it
may lead you, if you too far provoke your
nephew.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis, however, was not long subdued.
Her heart certainly misgave her; but she would
not show it; and she had a lingering hope
that perhaps Belassis did know more of the
history of his first wife than Miss Marjory
supposed. She had no great opinion of his
moral character or ability; but she doubted
whether he would dare to commit a crime like
bigamy.</p>

<p>‘I shall do as I think right,’ she said, with
a loftiness of manner which was well assumed,
though only an assumption. ‘Justice must be
done, at all costs. I may have been wronged,
but I will not permit wrong to go unpunished.’</p>

<p>Vials of wrath were being stored up to be
poured upon the head of Belassis; but here
matters must be carried with a high hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>‘Please yourself,’ answered Miss Marjory
pleasantly. ‘You seem to me very anxious
to court defeat and ridicule, but that is certainly
your business, not mine.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis felt that the interview had
lasted long enough, and she rose to go.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Torwood does not seem inclined to
hurry back,’ she said, ‘so I will not intrude
upon you longer. Tell him, with my compliments,
that if he declines to listen to me, he
will soon be forced to listen to Signor Pagliadini.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis walked rapidly from the house,
her mind in a tumult of angry feeling and
horrible uneasiness as regards her own position.
So engrossed was she, that she did not perceive,
until close upon him, the Italian, who
was walking up to Ladywell to pay the
promised visit. When face to face, she stopped
short and said:</p>

<p>‘They will dispute it. He means to keep
the name and position he has assumed. Try
your power, if you will; but his mind is
made up.’</p>

<p>Then, without waiting for a reply, she resumed
her rapid pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini was strangely preoccupied
that first evening at Ladywell. Make what
effort he would, it was plain to all that he had
something on his mind. It did not, then, surprise
Tor overmuch when, as the household
was preparing to disperse that night, he said:</p>

<p>‘Can I speak with you a few moments in
private?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, Signor,’ said Tor readily.</p>

<p>‘I am anxious not to be interrupted,’ continued
the Italian, with something of nervous
constraint in his manner. ‘Would it be asking
too much that you should join me in my
room, when your leisure permits it?’</p>

<p>‘I will be with you in ten minutes,’ said
Tor. ‘I have to go round the house, as usual.
I will not keep you waiting long.’</p>

<p>‘Do not hurry, Signor,’ said the Italian
courteously. ‘I will await your convenience.’</p>

<p>He went upstairs with his candle.</p>

<p>‘It is coming now,’ said Tor to Miss Marjory,
as he handed her hers. ‘Whatever it is,
I shall hear it now.’</p>

<p>‘Put on a bold face, then,’ advised Miss
Marjory, ‘as you did this afternoon. Never
say die! You will pull through yet.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>‘Perhaps; but something tells me that this
man is a very different kind of adversary from
Mrs. Belassis.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory was privately of the same
opinion, but she would not betray her uneasiness.</p>

<p>‘I wish I could be present to support you
again, but that would hardly do. Be bold,
and admit nothing. You have my best
wishes; and come what may, I will stand by
you.’</p>

<p>‘I believe it, and am grateful,’ said Tor;
and then they shook hands warmly, and after
the nightly prowl round the house, Tor, with
rather a sinking heart, mounted to Signor
Pagliadini’s room.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/i_pi.jpg" alt="I" /></div>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">t</span> will be necessary now to make a
break in the continuity of the story,
and return to the spotless bedchamber
in Dr. Schneeberger’s house, where
the real Phil Debenham lay so long.</p>

<p>For many weeks after Tor had left him, he
remained in a state of helpless torpor—knowing
nothing, hearing nothing, seeing
nothing—merely taking what nourishment was
given in a mechanical fashion, from which all
power of volition seemed absent.</p>

<p>But gradually a change came over the sick
man. By slow degrees, and without any
visible alteration in his condition, his brain began
to recover its faculties, and long before he
was inclined to evince any sign of life, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
able to hear, and in part to comprehend, what
went on around him.</p>

<p>At first his thoughts were very dim and
indistinct, and he was chiefly disturbed by a
haunting dread that Tor had left him. He
missed him, in a blind, unreasoning way, and
was vaguely distressed by the absence of his
friend, before he had really realized that he
was alone.</p>

<p>As his brain-power gradually strengthened
he took in other things.</p>

<p>He found that, to this unknown household,
wherever it might be, he was known as Herr
Torwood, and over this strange metamorphosis
he puzzled long and helplessly, and threw
himself again into unconsciousness for some
days.</p>

<p>When he woke again, his mind was still
clearer. He gave, however, no sign of comprehension,
partly because the effort to awake
his benumbed faculties seemed greater than he
cared as yet to make, partly because a vague
mistrust and uneasiness had fallen upon him,
and he felt that he must gain a clearer insight
into his surroundings, before he allowed it to
be seen that he had come to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>One day, whilst he was in this state, the
little German, whom he supposed to be a
doctor, because of his daily visits and careful
examinations—one day this German doctor
brought with him a medical friend, to whom
he talked long and learnedly over the supposed
condition of his patient’s brain.</p>

<p>Doctors and Germans, however, are not
above gossip, and after the medical side of the
subject had been exhaustively discussed, they
fell into another vein.</p>

<p>‘The Herr Debenham, his rich friend, will
be very much disturbed at this long insensibility,’
remarked Dr. Schneeberger.</p>

<p>‘Where, then, is this Herr Debenham?
Does he visit his friend often?’</p>

<p>‘No, he cannot. He is in England. I think
he is a great lord there. He has come into
some very vast property, I believe. Gretchen
thinks so, from what he told her when he was
here, after he had brought his friend to us. His
letters come from a Ladywell Manor. I believe
an English Manor is equal to a Schloss with
us. He may be a Graf, for all I know.’</p>

<p>‘He pays well for his friend here, I suppose?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>‘Very well. He is a true Englishman for
that. He was so anxious to leave Herr Torwood
with me, that I believe he would have
paid any sum I chose to ask. Ah! yes; he is
a liberal patron. I have a great respect for
Herr Debenham. Such a handsome Englishman,
too!’</p>

<p>‘Well to be his friend, then,’ said the other.
‘Does he purpose to come and see this one
ever?’</p>

<p>‘I am to send for him the moment I detect
any sign of returning sensibility. He is
very anxious to be with his friend when he
awakes from this long sleep. I confess I, too,
am anxious that he should be here, in case
what he expects should take place.’</p>

<p>‘What does he expect?’</p>

<p>‘He tells me that upon a former occasion,
when the Herr Torwood became unconscious
for a short time, he came to himself, believing
himself to be Herr Debenham; and
it was a good while before he could be convinced
of his own identity. Now this is a
very curious symptom, and will be interesting
to watch; but as I am a stranger to Herr
Torwood, I would rather his own friend was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
with him to convince him of his error. I might
find it difficult.’</p>

<p>‘What an odd thing!’ said the second doctor.
‘I never heard of a similar case. I wonder
if it will be so?’</p>

<p>‘Herr Debenham, I am sure, anticipates it.
He has alluded to it more than once in his
letters. He tells me that they have, from
time to time, passed under each other’s names
during their travels, which may perhaps
account, to a certain extent, for the confusion
of ideas.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps; still, it is an odd symptom. One
would be curious to watch its development.’</p>

<p>And then the two doctors took their departure,
leaving the patient, they supposed to
be so utterly vacant, in a very perturbed
state.</p>

<p>Phil’s mind was not altogether clear, the
true balance of his faculties was not entirely
restored. He could understand a great deal,
but he could not weigh possibilities, or grasp
a complex situation, as he could have done at
another time.</p>

<p>Had he been able to do this, it is probable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
he might have guessed somewhat at Tor’s
motive for acting as he had done. His entire
confidence in his friend would have sustained
him until he could see him face to face, and
learn the truth from his own lips. But in its
present clouded state, his mind could only take
in one thing at a time; and the fact which he
had firmly grasped, through overhearing this
conversation, was that his friend had defrauded
him of his name and position, and was living
upon his estate, whilst he had taken care that
the real possessor should not be believed when
he did recover consciousness, and have power
to assert his claim.</p>

<p>Ladywell was a name well known to Phil.
The Manor House had been his ideal of all a
house should be, from his childhood’s days,
when he and little Maud had played in secluded
corners of the park. The old uncle, who was
regarded as something of an ogre, to be feared
and avoided, was only dimly remembered; but
Phil had always known that he was his great-uncle’s
natural heir, and with the buoyant
hopefulness of his nature, had entertained a
dim expectation that the property might, by
some lucky chance, come to him, either by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
testamentary bequest, or (in absence of will)
as heir-at-law.</p>

<p>Evidently this is what had taken place.
The old man had died. The property had
come to him, and Tor, forgetting under pressure
of temptation all his old honour and uprightness,
had taken advantage of Phil’s helplessness,
and of the fact that he was a perfect stranger
to his own relations, and had claimed the
inheritance as his own, calmly transferring his
own name and personality to his unconscious
friend, and adopting Phil’s instead.</p>

<p>Phil writhed in helpless irritation and dismay
when the whole force of the situation
broke upon him. He had no clue to Tor’s
real motive; naturally it did not occur to him
to imagine it. He could think of nothing but
the treacherous way in which he had been
defrauded, and of what possible steps he could
take to free himself from the net which had
been cast about him.</p>

<p>One thing was self-evident. He must
remain in a state of apparent insensibility for
the present. If he betrayed one gleam of
consciousness, Tor would be summoned; and
once let Tor’s strong hand close over him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Phil knew that he should be powerless. He
had not lived eighteen years in close company,
without knowing Tor’s strength of will and
purpose; and he knew that in an open struggle
he would simply be crushed. Tor’s word, not
his, would be believed; and if he were to be
resolute in his declaration that he was Philip
Debenham, he might, for all he knew, be housed
in a madhouse before many days were over.</p>

<p>It was a terrible suspicion, and quite sufficed
to keep up all Phil’s determination to remain
quiet until he had matured some plan of
escape.</p>

<p>From time to time some of the old loving
confidence in Tor would assert itself, and Phil
would be half tempted to have him summoned,
and learn from his own lips how it was that he
had acted thus; but then again doubts and
fears filled his mind, and the risk seemed too
great a one to run.</p>

<p>Suppose Tor was his enemy? Suppose, having
made one false step, he had then advanced
until retreat should be impossible? Such things
had happened before, and might happen again.
When once a man had fallen, had begun a course
of deceit and treachery, it was a hard matter to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
draw back. Phil was ready to believe that
Tor might have acted, in the first place, simply
from an impulse of ambition; but he could
not get over his fear, that having once announced
to the world that he was Philip
Debenham, and assumed the position at Ladywell
Manor to which the name entitled him,
he would be prepared to stick to his colours at
all cost, and would never admit himself a liar,
an impostor, and a forger.</p>

<p>No; come what might, Tor would make up
his mind, and he would yield to nothing but
actual force. He would never submit to humiliation
and disgrace, and he had evidently
taken every means in his power to ensure
himself against danger. He would never willingly
let Phil escape from his clutches, and
therefore it would be necessary to use subtlety
before he could hope to obtain his freedom.</p>

<p>For many days Phil lay silent and motionless,
making plans and weighing possibilities.
As the helplessness of his condition grew more
and more apparent, so did his bitterness increase
against his former friend.</p>

<p>‘Friend’ indeed! Phil often smiled mournfully
over the mockery of the word; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
would lie for hours brooding over the strange,
mysterious change which must have come
over Tor, before he could stoop to such
treachery and baseness. ‘Mine own familiar
friend,’ he would sometimes murmur to himself
over and over again; ‘mine own familiar
friend,’ until the words seemed to haunt him
night and day, as the most expressive in the
whole language of thought. Yes, it was ever
so; it was no new thing, this sudden betrayal
of confidence, this treacherous attack from one
who had answered to the sacred name of
friend. It had been true thousands of years
ago, and it was true that day. The history of
the world could furnish countless instances of
that same crime; and as the great Roman
Emperor found, it was the hand of the familiar
friend which was readiest to strike the deathblow.</p>

<p>‘Et tu, Brute?’</p>

<p>Those words of dignity and pathos have
passed into a household word, but never
before had Phil so realized their melancholy
and touching significance.</p>

<p>‘Mine own familiar friend’—yes, indeed.
It was to that very familiarity, that implicit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
confidence which existed between them that
Tor owed the power to practise this great deception.
This was an added pang, and cost
Phil many hours of bitter thought.</p>

<p>He had learned during these days of consciousness
how this household, of which he
seemed a member, divided its time. He knew
when food would be brought up for him, and at
what hour the doctor paid his daily visit. He
knew when to expect the maid to sweep out
the room and dust the furniture, and he
equally knew when he should be left long
hours in solitude.</p>

<p>One day, at this time, he tried the experiment
of getting up. He found his strength
less impaired than he had feared, for he had
but a dim idea of the flight of time, and did
not know if months or weeks had passed since
he had been laid low, nor did he understand
exactly what it was that had ailed him.</p>

<p>After a few trials, made day by day, he was
able to stand and walk without any great
difficulty; the giddiness he experienced at first
diminished with every trial.</p>

<p>Soon he was able to stand and sit for some
time; and he then began a careful search for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
any papers which Tor might have left behind,
by accident or design, which could throw any
light upon the subject which so haunted
him.</p>

<p>He soon saw that an exchange of personal
trifles had been effected; watches and seals,
cigar-cases, pencils, pocket-books, all had been
changed, evidently because they bore upon
them some clue to the owner’s identity. In
Tor’s pocket-book, which had been left behind,
was a sealed packet, which, to Phil’s great
astonishment, contained English bank-notes
to the value of £500.</p>

<p>He looked utterly amazed, and then his face
clouded.</p>

<p>‘Is it a bribe? or is it a trap?—I cannot
tell. But if I can escape, this money will be
everything in my chance of success. Ah! and
here is a paper—what can this be?’</p>

<p>It was the lawyer’s letter informing Phil of
his accession to wealth and property. The
very reading of it, with the associations called
up by the various items of intelligence, was
enough to set Phil’s heart beating with impatient
longing. The other papers Tor had
taken away with him, so that Maud’s letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
and Mr. Maynard’s could explain nothing; although
in them lay the clue to Tor’s reckless
deed.</p>

<p>Phil placed everything exactly as he had
found it, and lay down again to meditate.</p>

<p>His plan—the plan which for days and days
had been slowly shaping itself in his brain,
was this: He must escape from his present
captivity, but must escape in such a way that
no uneasiness should be excited in Tor’s mind—he
must remain in ignorance of the matter.</p>

<p>Once free from restraint and with money in
his pocket, Phil would go in disguise to Ladywell,
and watch what the enemy was about.
He could then calculate what were his chances
of success, should he bring an action against
him; and he might possibly be able to detect
some extenuating circumstances which should
make the crime less black.</p>

<p>Not willingly had Phil believed his friend a
traitor; and there still lurked in his heart
some hopes of a future reconciliation. But
doubt and distrust were very strong, and the
feeling of helplessness most trying. Tor had
taken possession of every credential Phil could
have brought forward as proof of his identity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
and, as it were, cut away the ground from
under his feet in every possible way.</p>

<p>Phil knew nothing of his likeness to his
family, and was not man of the world enough
to see that his own knowledge and recollection
of the events of his childhood and of his native
place, as opposed to Tor’s ignorance, would
go far towards making good his case, were
it brought before competent authority. He
could only see at present that it would be his
bare word, against Tor’s word backed by all
the credentials which should have been his.
He knew Tor would be no mean opponent,
and his heart sank at the thought of a hand-to-hand
fight.</p>

<p>No, he must go disguised, whilst Tor believed
him still in Germany, and then he
would try to read the riddle; and if he dared,
he would confront his false friend face to face,
and wrest the truth from him by threat, or by
sheer force of justice.</p>

<p>But this plan of escape involved the co-operation
of the German doctor, in whose care
he had been left; and it might be a difficult,
even a dangerous matter to secure it.</p>

<p>However, Phil was not without a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
dogged obstinacy of his own, and he determined
that he would at least make a bold
attempt, and trust to chance for success.</p>

<p>Upon the following day, when the doctor
visited him, he received him with wide-open
eyes, and a look of quiet comprehension, which
sent the little man into a silent ecstasy of
delight.</p>

<p>‘Dr. Schneeberger,’ began Phil, after he
had calmly and rationally replied to some
dozen searching questions, ‘will you sit down
for a few minutes and listen to something of
importance that I have to say?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, my dear sir, certainly. I am
only too delighted. What news this will be
for your good friend! I think I ought to send
him a telegram at once to inform him.’</p>

<p>‘Not just yet, if you please, doctor,’ said
Phil quietly; ‘I want you first to hear
what I have to say to you.’</p>

<p>‘I will listen to anything, so long as you do
not too greatly fatigue yourself.’</p>

<p>‘I will be careful not to do so. Now,
doctor, I am going to ask you a few questions.
Was I not brought here several weeks ago by
a tall, good-looking Englishman, who gave his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
name as Debenham? And did he not inform
you that my name was Torwood?’</p>

<p>Dr. Schneeberger nodded his head.</p>

<p>‘Certainly—exactly. You have accurately
stated the case.’</p>

<p>‘And did he, or did he not, warn you that
when I recovered my senses, I should be under
the impression that <i>my</i> name was Debenham?’</p>

<p>The doctor stared.</p>

<p>‘Well—ah! let me see—well, yes, he certainly
did give me some such warning; but I
cannot imagine how you came to know it.’</p>

<p>He was looking very curiously at his
patient, as if to detect some new and strange
phenomenon in his case. But Phil confronted
him with an unwavering eye, and spoke on
connectedly and quietly.</p>

<p>‘I know it, or guessed it, from what I know
of the circumstances which surround me, and
from what I heard and remarked whilst I
seemed to you to be still unconscious.’</p>

<p>‘You have recovered, then, gradually?’
cried the doctor eagerly. ‘It was not the work
of a moment?’</p>

<p>‘I have been slowly recovering for several
days; but this is the first time that I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
felt any inclination to rouse myself and let it
be known. You have doubtless known similar
cases?’</p>

<p>Dr. Schneeberger assented readily, and
talked a good deal of the brain and its various
developments. Phil listened with praiseworthy
patience, until a pause gave him the
opportunity to proceed.</p>

<p>‘When this friend of mine informed you
that he considered it probable I should claim
the name of Debenham upon my recovery, did
it not strike you as a very odd thing for him
to suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Well, yes; certainly it was a remarkable
symptom, one which interested me greatly.’</p>

<p>‘Did you ever know of a case in which,
after the brief confusion of ideas on first recovery,
a man did not know his own
name?’</p>

<p>‘Well, no; I certainly have not known of
such a case; but one is always making fresh
discoveries in the book of Nature.’</p>

<p>‘Or of art,’ suggested Phil. ‘And now,
doctor, your candid opinion: do you think it
likely, do you consider it practically possible,
for a man to recover the full use of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
faculties, and yet not to know who he
is?’</p>

<p>The doctor hummed and hawed a little,
but admitted that it seemed rather an improbable
idea, when looked at in that light.</p>

<p>‘I want you to look at it in this light; not
simply from a medical point of view. Treat
me as a man, not as a patient, and tell me if
it never occurred to you what could be the
reason for such a statement on the part of my
friend.’</p>

<p>‘He said it had occurred before, and might
recur in this instance.’</p>

<p>‘And it never struck you as possible that I
might really be Philip Debenham, and he the
Torwood he wished to make me out?’</p>

<p>The doctor stared, and eyed him suspiciously.</p>

<p>‘No, certainly; such an idea as that never
occurred to me for a moment.’</p>

<p>‘Think over the idea for a moment, doctor,
and see what you make of it.’</p>

<p>Dr. Schneeberger looked puzzled, and
seemed to turn the matter over in his mind,
looking all the while meditatively at Phil.</p>

<p>‘You see that I know what I am saying?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, you certainly do that.’</p>

<p>‘I am talking to you now in a foreign
tongue. I am ready to answer any and every
question you like to put upon any subject with
which I am acquainted. I can tell you, as I
mean to do, the whole of my past history, or
talk to you in half a dozen languages. Do
you think it is possible that I do not know my
own name?’</p>

<p>‘It seems improbable; but we will have
your friend over, and hear all he has to say.
Why should he say he is a Debenham if he is
not?’</p>

<p>‘He had a very adequate motive, as I will
show you. My name gained for him wealth
and position, and landed property of considerable
value. I will tell you all about it immediately;
but first promise me one thing—not
to write yet to my friend to tell him of the
change in my state. You must promise me
this.’</p>

<p>‘But I promised him——’</p>

<p>‘Never mind that promise now. Wait at
least until you have heard my story. One
day cannot make much difference. You will
do dreadful mischief if you do not listen to me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The poor little man, unused to face difficulties
of this kind, gave way without much
demur.</p>

<p>‘I will hear your story, at least. That
cannot do harm, nor lose much time. If it
will not tire you, mein Herr, I am ready to
listen to it now.’</p>

<p>So Phil began the story of his life, and told
it clearly and consecutively from beginning to
end. He told of his eccentric great-uncle and
the Ladywell property, to which he was
natural heir. He told all the family history,
and was too clear and succinct to speak from
mere hearsay. Finally, he told of his awakening
from this strange sleep, to find that the
property had suddenly become his own, and
that his trusted friend and comrade had played
Jacob’s part toward him, and had supplanted
him in his inheritance.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">y</span> the time Phil had finished his story,
his listener was quite convinced that
he was in his right mind, and that
he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>He had tested him by questions likely to
confuse a mind not perfectly clear, but Phil had
answered everything with perfect readiness,
and had avoided any of those blunders or contradictions
which any hallucination must have
occasioned.</p>

<p>Dr. Schneeberger, though simple-minded,
was a shrewd observer of human nature, and
he was convinced that Phil’s story was true,
and that he was the victim of gross injustice
at the hands of his supposed friend.</p>

<p>Tor, he said to himself, just looked like a
man who would dare anything, and make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
everything and everybody give way before
him. He had been pleased before by his open,
authoritative manner; but now it struck him
as an index to a wild, unregulated nature.</p>

<p>Friendship was a sacred thing in the eyes of
this little German, and he was much horrified
at this cruel desecration just revealed to him.</p>

<p>‘Dr. Schneeberger,’ said Phil, ‘you see, I
think, that it is necessary for me to escape
from the power of this false friend.’</p>

<p>‘Are you in his power?’</p>

<p>‘I fear I shall find myself so. He will compass
everything rather than give me liberty to
speak the truth before the world. Can you
not see for yourself how he has manœuvred to
keep me in his power? He told you I was
given to delusions as to my identity. He
urged you to send for him the moment I
showed any glimmer of consciousness. Does
it not all point to the one conclusion that his
aim is to make me out an imbecile, and so
retain control over my movements?’</p>

<p>‘It may be so,’ answered the doctor slowly;
‘but yet he did not look like playing so base
a part.’</p>

<p>‘No; he had barely taken the first step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
then. Now he has plunged recklessly into the
mire of treachery and deceit. Think for yourself,
doctor—if he is capable of assuming my
name and my inheritance, is he not capable
also of doing much to keep me from exposing
him?’</p>

<p>Dr. Schneeberger shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>‘I cannot say it is impossible. I fear you
have only too good cause for all you say.’</p>

<p>‘You would indeed say so more emphatically
still, did you but know Mr. Torwood’s
strength of will, and his power of bending circumstances
and individuals to it. I stand in
no small danger—of that I am convinced; and
I must act at once, and that secretly. I have
a plan, but I shall want your help in carrying
it out. Will you stand my friend, doctor?’</p>

<p>‘I will, mein Herr, as far as possible.’</p>

<p>‘Your part is simple. All you have to do
is to let me leave your roof, without letting
the would-be Mr. Debenham know. He must
suppose me to be here, whilst really I shall be
watching him at close quarters.’</p>

<p>‘Watching him! Will you then run into
danger by going near to him?’</p>

<p>‘I shall go disguised. I have money: I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
soon so alter myself that none will know me.
My beard has grown, and that in itself is a
great disguise. I hardly knew myself when I
saw my own reflection for the first time. I
must watch the enemy at close quarters before
I can strike. I must find out his weak points,
and see if there are any in my old neighbourhood
who will stand my friends. I must be
on the spot; but it must be impossible for
him to suspect who I am. You must write
from time to time to say that I am here,
and continue in the same unconscious state.
He <i>cannot</i> then suspect.’</p>

<p>Dr. Schneeberger considered this proposition
awhile, and then slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>‘It will not do,’ he said. ‘It would be
dangerous for us both. Any time the Herr
might take it into his head to come over and
visit you—I wonder he has not done so
already. Suppose he came and found you
away, what then would happen?’</p>

<p>Phil looked blank as this idea was propounded.
The suggestion was reasonable
enough, and showed him more and more how
much of a prisoner he was.</p>

<p>‘What, then, can be done?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>The doctor sat in deep thought. This time
it was from him that the suggestion came.</p>

<p>‘Mein Herr, does your friend know much of
the science of medicine?’</p>

<p>‘Not an atom, I should imagine.’</p>

<p>‘Then it would not occur to him, perhaps,
as an odd method of treating supposed compression
of the brain, to send the patient upon
a sea-voyage?’</p>

<p>Phil’s eyes brightened slowly.</p>

<p>‘No, doctor; I don’t suppose it would. Go
on.’</p>

<p>‘Anyone who had studied the subject would
not be likely to approve such an experiment;
but if your friend does not understand these
matters, I could easily lead him to suppose
that such a course of treatment would be
beneficial to you, and he might be willing for
you to go.’</p>

<p>‘And then?’ questioned Phil eagerly.</p>

<p>‘And then, mein Herr, whilst you were supposed
to be sailing over the wide ocean, under
the care of a medical friend of mine own, you
could in reality be playing the part you have
laid down for yourself; whilst I, for my part,
could forward to the Herr letters, purporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
to come from my friend, with accounts of Herr
Torwood’s health. As they would be written
to me, no envelopes need be sent; and I could
fabricate the date, and the port from which it
was written, as easily as the letter itself with
its medical details.’</p>

<p>‘Doctor,’ said Phil solemnly, ‘you are a
brick!—if you know what that is. Write to
Ladywell this afternoon; don’t lose a single
day nor hour. Propound this idea of the sea-voyage,
and urge it so that in common
humanity he can hardly refuse.’</p>

<p>‘I will,’ answered the doctor, who could be
a warm partizan when he once espoused a
cause. ‘And now, mein Herr, I think you
had better return to your former state of
torpor. It will not be well for Gretchen or
the Mädchen to know that this change has
taken place; only we ourselves must be in
the secret. But I will write at once to Herr
Debenham.’</p>

<p>Tor’s answer came as quickly as post could
bring it, and contained the information that
he was following his letter with all speed.</p>

<p>For one moment Phil was filled with a great
longing to meet his old friend face to face, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
ask him, then and there, what was the meaning
of this strange treachery; but soon the new
fear and distrust rose up again within him—the
knowledge of the power Tor always had
exercised over him (to which in old days he
had loved to submit, and which had always
been generously exercised) came back to his
memory, and made him fear to meet him; for
there could be no doubt that the old generosity
and friendliness must all have vanished, and
given place to a malice and treachery which
would make him a most dangerous enemy.</p>

<p>And yet Phil’s heart misgave him sometimes,
and smote him for the part he was
about to play. True, he had been greatly
wronged, ruthlessly betrayed and deceived;
but did that justify him in deceiving, in his
turn, the man to whom he owed so much?</p>

<p>Phil felt restless and miserable as he turned
over the question in his mind.</p>

<p>‘If he calls me “Phil” again, as he used to
do, I don’t believe I can hold out. Oh, Tor,
Tor! why are you treating me like this?’</p>

<p>Sounds in the hall below announced the
arrival of the expected guest. Phil, with a
hasty movement, drew the sheet over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
lower part of his face, so as to hide the beard,
upon which he was to rely in a great measure
for his disguise. Then he lay motionless and
rigid, with closed eyes and set face.</p>

<p>He knew that Tor was standing over him,
but he moved not an eyelash, although his
heart beat so loud as to drown the sense of what
was passing between the two men who stood
beside the bed.</p>

<p>‘He is going to speak to me,’ said Phil to
himself, when first he was able to grasp the
meaning of words uttered in that familiar
voice. ‘What will he say?’</p>

<p>‘Tor—Torwood! wake up, old fellow!
Don’t you know me—Phil Debenham? Tor,
I say!’</p>

<p>Phil’s heart seemed turned to stone, and he
lay still and motionless. Hope died within
him as suddenly as it had leapt up. Tor had
adopted his <i>rôle</i> in earnest, and he would
abide by his choice. By stratagem, not by
force, was he now to be overcome.</p>

<p>On the following day Tor departed, and
upon the next, Phil did the same. Greatly to
his relief, no mention had been made of the
money so strangely left in the pocket-book.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Either Tor had forgotten the matter, or else
he had his own reasons for keeping silence.
Phil cared little as to that, so long as he
retained in his hands the necessary funds for
his enterprise.</p>

<p>He was carried from the doctor’s house like
a log, and his host accompanied him in the
carriage. By the time he reached the wayside
inn, where a halt was called, the doctor
assisted him to alight and dismissed the
driver, who merely observed that the sick man
had recovered somewhat during the drive.
He was not the man usually employed by
Dr. Schneeberger, and knew nothing about
him or his charge.</p>

<p>Once at the inn, Phil recovered rapidly,
and by four o’clock the doctor and he bid
each other a cordial adieu; and the former
returned to his house, to give the innocent
Gretchen a graphic account of the journey,
and to tell her that his patient had been duly
handed over to the mythical medical friend,
who was to convey him down to the ship.</p>

<p>As for Phil, he felt like a bird escaped from
the snare of the fowler, rejoicing once again in
the full use of his liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>He remained that night where he was, for
he had a vague fear that too rapid travelling
might bring him into collision with Tor, and
he was anxious above all things not to
risk an encounter with him, until the right
moment had arrived.</p>

<p>His disguise occupied much of his thought
and attention, and he determined to go to
Paris to obtain it; having unbounded faith in
French art.</p>

<p>He made a wise choice; and Paris certainly
turned him out a vastly altered man.</p>

<p>First, his brown beard was cut in truly
foreign fashion, and dyed an inky black. A
costly wig of raven-black hair, of distinct
Italian style, so altered the character of brow
and face, that Phil hardly knew his own reflection
in the glass. Art had no difficulty in
darkening his eyebrows and giving them an
arch not actually intended by nature; and a
pair of gold-rimmed glasses with smoked lenses
gave a totally altered expression to the one
feature he feared would betray him.</p>

<p>One or two carefully padded coats, of distinct
Parisian cut, gave a breadth and solidity
of figure quite unlike Phil’s own slight and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
wiry proportions, and transformed him into a
foreigner quite as much as did the Italian
hair.</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m not a bad-looking fellow, at any
rate,’ said he, carefully surveying his reflected
image, when all his preparations were complete.
‘But I’m hanged if I should know
myself if I were to meet myself in the street.
A few more applications of that fellow’s wash
will produce a clear olive complexion, and I
don’t think I need be afraid then of Tor or
anybody else. I look most like an Italian,
so an Italian I’ll be. I think I’m equal to the
language. I was always told I spoke it like a
native, and I don’t feel as if I could easily
be puzzled. Yes, I’ll be an Italian, and my
name shall be—shall be—say Pagliadini, Marco
Pagliadini; that will do as well as any other.’</p>

<p>Since his metamorphosis, he had left his
first hotel, and just arrived at a second, in the
empty <i>salon</i> of which he now stood, surveying
himself in the long mirrors.</p>

<p>A confusion of tongues became audible in
the hall without, and a waiter put his head
into the <i>salon</i>, and then advanced with a
bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>‘Is it possible that Monsieur is an Italian?’
he asked obsequiously.</p>

<p>‘Yes, certainly,’ answered Phil, with a half-smile
at his own readiness.</p>

<p>‘Then might I solicit the aid of Monsieur
for one of his compatriots, who cannot make
himself to be comprehended in our language?
If Monsieur would have the complaisance to
go to his assistance, I am sure he would receive
a thousand thanks.’</p>

<p>Phil assented readily, and found a fine-looking
old Italian in the hall, vainly trying to
make known his wishes to the mistress of the
hotel; but his command of the French
tongue was not great enough to make her understand
that he had been taking photographs
of some neighbouring landscapes, and was now
anxious to expose his negatives in a dark
cellar.</p>

<p>With Phil’s assistance, however, the matter
soon became amicably settled, and the Italian,
in his gratitude to his young countryman,
insisted on his company at dinner that
night.</p>

<p>Phil spent a very pleasant evening with
Signor Mattei, his intelligent and courteous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
host, who, after much talk of art, during
which Phil rose higher and higher in his
estimation, began to question him a little as
to his own plans.</p>

<p>‘I am going to England,’ Phil told him candidly.
‘I have not been there since I was
quite a child. I am curious to see something
of so great a country.’</p>

<p>‘Are you going to visit friends?’</p>

<p>‘No; I go simply as a traveller, bent on
pleasure and instruction.’</p>

<p>‘But you surely have introductions?’</p>

<p>‘No, not even an introduction. I shall be a
stranger to everyone I meet.’</p>

<p>‘Surely that will be very <i>triste</i>?’</p>

<p>‘If so, I can but return.’</p>

<p>Signor Mattei pulled his long white moustache
and considered awhile.</p>

<p>‘You have done me a very kind service,
young Signor,’ he said. ‘I should like, if it
were possible, to be of some service to you;
but unfortunately I know little of England or
the English.’</p>

<p>‘I am exceedingly obliged by your kind
wish, Signor; but pray do not give any
anxiety to such a matter. I shall make my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
way excellently, I have no doubt. I am not
afraid.’</p>

<p>Still Signor Mattei seemed to ponder.</p>

<p>‘I suppose, Signor, you will not be going
into remote parts—into the West-country, for
instance, where the scenery is said to be very
beautiful?’</p>

<p>‘Well, yes; I am thinking of visiting
Devonshire. I was there as a child, and should
like to see the country again.’</p>

<p>‘In that case I might perhaps be of use to
you. A very good friend and relative of
mine (by marriage, you understand, for he is
an Englishman) lives in that country, at a
place called Ladywell. His name is Michael
Meredith, and when my niece, his wife, died,
he returned to his native country, to live near
an old patron of his, a Mr. Debenham, who
also lived there. He is a great lover of art,
and of all that belongs to our country. He
is blind, which is a sad trial to him, and
would make a visit from one of our nation
doubly grateful. If you would accept an introduction
to him, I am sure it would be
doing a kindness to him, and might be advantageous
to yourself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>This marvellous coincidence had almost
taken Phil’s breath away. Michael Meredith’s
name was dimly remembered by him; and he
accepted with alacrity the offered introduction.</p>

<p>What wonderful luck he had!</p>

<p>The one difficulty he had seen looming before
him was now overcome.</p>

<p>He had wondered how he should be able to
gain the first footing amongst the people he
was so anxious to watch.</p>

<p>He could not hang about the place for ever,
though sketching or fishing might give colour
to a good deal of loitering round. But, as a
rule, foreigners do not remain very long in
isolated country villages, for no ostensible
reason. Suspicion might be attracted to him,
which he was most anxious to avoid; and it
might be very difficult for him to gain the
<i>entrée</i> of his own house.</p>

<p>Now, however, his way was made plain.
He would appear at Ladywell as Michael
Meredith’s friend. Not a ghost of a suspicion
could attach to him, unless he chose to arouse
it. Tor, as a supposed Debenham, must be
acquainted with his father’s old friend, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
meeting would be easily contrived. Nothing
more fortunate could have been conceived,
and Phil felt as if victory was almost attained,
when Signor Mattei handed over to him a
very cordial note of introduction to Michael
Meredith.</p>

<p>‘I trust it may be of use to you, Signor,’ he
said politely.</p>

<p>‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered Phil, as
calmly as he could. ‘I shall make an early
expedition to Devonshire to see the Signor
Meredith.’</p>

<p>‘You will do him a great kindness, I am
convinced,’ said Signor Mattei.</p>

<p>‘And myself also,’ responded Phil truthfully
enough; and the elder man bowed and
smiled, and was all the more favourably impressed
by the courteously-worded thanks of
his young friend.</p>

<p>The two ‘compatriots’ parted soon afterwards
upon the best of terms.</p>

<p>When Phil read through the open letter
which the Signor had given him, he was
pleased to find it so worded, as to give the impression
that Signor Pagliadini was no mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
acquaintance of an hour, but a friend of some
standing. Signor Mattei, with a somewhat
exaggerated wish to speak well of his young
friend, had thought it best not to give any
hint as to the length of time the friendship
had lasted, and leave the date of its commencement
to the imagination of his relative.
From what he said of Phil’s knowledge of art,
and his taste upon all questions relating to
painting and sculpture, one would certainly
imagine that the two men had been acquainted
for some time. He had also omitted to
date the letter from Paris, and so it might
naturally be supposed to come from Florence,
where, as Phil had discovered, the Signor
habitually resided.</p>

<p>‘It’s not a matter of much importance, I suppose,’
he said to himself: ‘still, it’s as well to
throw as much dust in people’s eyes as one
easily can. It might just as well be supposed
that I have come direct from Florence, so
that if Tor should ask questions he will not
learn the truth.’</p>

<p>He paced up and down, speaking from time
to time to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>‘I won’t be harder upon him than I can—I
don’t want to disgrace him. He has been a
good friend to me; and I will be as generous
as he will let me. But I cannot stand by altogether
and see myself supplanted. I cannot
change myself into Torrington Torwood because
he has chosen to make himself Phil Debenham.</p>

<p>‘I will feel my way carefully. I will say
that I have known the two abroad. Perhaps
I will even greet him as Torwood, and see what
he says. That might be a good thought, and
might give him an opening to confess the
truth. I might put the same doubt into other
people’s minds, and let an uncomfortable state
of uncertainty fall upon them in regard to his
position. I am sure I shall not be recognised.
I will speak no English, only Italian, and then
my voice will be in a great measure disguised.
I will haunt him and trouble him, and give
him every chance to retract his false step and
tell the truth; but if he will not yield, even
when he finds that I know the truth, then I
must take up arms in my own defence; and
he must look to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Tor! Tor!’ cried Phil, with sudden,
irrepressible bitterness. ‘Why do you drive
me into such a course? Why do you make an
enemy of me—I who have so loved you? Oh,
Tor! Tor! Mine own familiar friend!’</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">t</span> was with very strange and mixed
feelings that Philip Debenham
found himself once again in his
native village.</p>

<p>The place was almost unchanged by the
eighteen years that had passed since he had
seen it last. A few cottages had vanished; a
few more had been built. His old home had
been altered past recognition; but little else
was changed, so far as the larger houses were
concerned.</p>

<p>He saw the well-known, square, uncompromising
mansion of his Uncle Belassis, and gave
it a look of instinctive aversion, remembering
dimly the unhappy hours he had spent there
as a boy.</p>

<p>He recognised with a smile the grey, ivycovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
church which he had attended as a
child, and could even recall the subjects of the
stained windows which he had so admired, and
recollect the half-fearful, half-delighted interest
he and Maud used to take in a carved death’s
head and cross-bones, which surmounted one
of the tablets facing the pew in which they
had sat.</p>

<p>A great longing rose up within him to see
again the little sister, who had been his playfellow
and devoted slave in the far-away childhood’s
years. Where was she now? Living
still at Thornton House? Tor could not have
brought her to Ladywell, he thought—odd as
it might seem not to do so. He would have
given much for one loving kiss from Maud,
for one of the caresses he knew were his due;
but he was a stranger and an alien, and could
only come in disguise to see his own inheritance.</p>

<p>Ladywell lay embosomed in woods, which
now wore their full summer foliage. He could
not see his own house, and yet the very
thought that it was his own, thrilled him with
a pride and delight he had not felt before.</p>

<p>He remembered well the fine old place he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
had visited from time to time with his father.
He could see, with his mind’s eye, the great
terrace, the smooth lawns, and brilliant flowerbeds;
the hot-houses and conservatories, and
the fine stables where he had loved to wander,
petting and admiring the horses who were
stalled there.</p>

<p>The inside of the house he remembered less
vividly, but the idea of size and magnificence
was strongly stamped upon his brain; and he
heaved a sigh at the thought which rose in his
mind, that his accession to his own property
could only be obtained by the disgrace of the
man who had once been his dearest, almost his
only friend.</p>

<p>‘What’s that fine place?’ asked a fellow-traveller,
of the driver, as the conveyance which
had brought them both from Darwen drove up
to the village.</p>

<p>‘Ladywell Manor, sir—finest place in the
county.’ For the village people were loyal in
their admiration of their own Manor House.</p>

<p>‘Who owns it?’</p>

<p>‘Old Squire were Mr. Maynard—a queer
old gentleman by all accounts, who never saw
nobody. He never was married, and left the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
place to his nephew, Mr. Debenham. He’s
main popular is the new Squire, though he’s
not long come back from his travels; a pleasant-spoke,
free-handed young gentleman as ever
trod shoe-leather, and as strong and big as
John the blacksmith, and he’s the biggest man
down these parts.’</p>

<p>‘Is he a married man?—the Squire, I mean,
not the blacksmith.’</p>

<p>‘No, he ain’t married not yet. He’s been
a-knocking about the world, they say, till now,
and hasn’t hardly had time to turn round, so far.
He’s got his aunt living up there now, a widow
lady, and his sister; but he won’t want for a
wife long. Why, he’s the best match in the
country-side, to say nothing of his good looks.
Oh yes, sir, we’re a bit proud of our new
Squire. You see, the old un wasn’t greatly
thought on; and this here Mr. Debenham, he’s
the right sort all round. There’s not a soul in
all Ladywell as hasn’t a good word for the
Squire, or who wouldn’t stand up for him
through thick and thin, so as he needed it.’</p>

<p>This conversation, casually overheard, had
given Phil a good deal of food for meditation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>‘It is plain he has not let grass grow under
his feet,’ he thought. ‘He has played the
old trick—won the hearts of the people to
strengthen his own position. Who could have
thought it of Tor? Yet what else can I think?
Facts speak for themselves.’</p>

<p>That evening and the following morning he
spent in restless wanderings and anxious
thought.</p>

<p>He could not talk to the people, because he
wished to make out that his English was of
the most imperfect kind; and, with all his
brooding and thinking, he could not decide
upon a regular plan of action.</p>

<p>The Debenham indecision was in his nature,
and there was now no Tor at his side to give
ready advice and assistance. He had for the
first time to stand alone and act for himself,
and all he could make up his mind to do,
was to drift along with the tide of circumstances,
and be guided by his own impulse
what to say and what to leave unsaid.</p>

<p>It was not perhaps a very wise resolve, but
it was eminently characteristic of Phil’s habit
of mind. Had Mr. Belassis had his real
nephew to deal with from the first, things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
might have turned out very differently for all
parties concerned.</p>

<p>In this indecisive frame of mind Phil stood
at Mr. Meredith’s door, and was admitted to
Roma’s studio.</p>

<p>Roma, as Tor had said to Maud, possessed
that type of beauty which Phil most admired,
and the longer they talked the greater grew
his admiration.</p>

<p>The bust of Maud in the studio at once
arrested his attention, and he saw at a glance
whose portrait it must be, from its obvious
likeness to himself. Given this opening, he
followed it up, talking of the Filippo he had
once known, making up his mind that he
would contrive to make Tor pretty uncomfortable.</p>

<p>His next interview, with Mr. Meredith, was
very satisfactory. From the first moment it
was evident he had made a favourable impression.
Something in his voice fell pleasantly
and familiarly upon the sensitive ear of the
blind man, and caused him to assert more than
once that he must have met Signor Pagliadini
before.</p>

<p>When the introduction from Signor Mattei<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
was brought forward, Phil had himself to
read it to the blind man. By a dexterous
and very slight transposition and alteration,
the impression conveyed by the letter was, that
Marco Pagliadini was quite an old friend, and
had been known to Signor Mattei from his
youth upwards.</p>

<p>The invitation to become an inmate at
Michael Meredith’s was very welcome, and
was so warmly pressed that it had not to be
too eagerly accepted. Fortune certainly
seemed to favour Phil, for as a guest in this
house he could not fail to have many opportunities
for making inquiries and finding out
all that was possible about Tor’s line of action.
His former acquaintance with the two Englishmen,
which he lost no time in making known,
gave colour to the interest he could not but
show in all connected with Ladywell, and
especially in the actions of its present master.</p>

<p>He was ill pleased to find what warm allies
he had made even in this house. Mr. Meredith
was never tired of singing his praises,
and even Roma threw off something of her
usual calm to defend, when Phil made a
covert attack upon him, the man who, did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
she but know it, so ill deserved her goodwill.</p>

<p>Tor’s hasty disappearance, to avoid a meeting
with anyone who had known him abroad,
was a significant fact, and showed that he was
really ill at ease, in spite of his popularity.</p>

<p>But that evening spent in company with
Roma lulled into temporary oblivion all
thoughts of anger or vengeance. Roma was,
in his opinion, the most beautiful woman he
had ever met, and his somewhat fervent nature
was soon all ablaze with the ardour of a
dangerous admiration, all the more dangerous
because Roma seemed with every hour to grow
more gentle, more pensive, more trustful.</p>

<p>He almost forgot the object of his visit in
the happiness of her society, and he was far
upon the way from which there is no retreat,
before the first evening had passed. It
seemed to him that his one object in coming
to England had been to find Roma, and that
to win her love was now the only object worth
living for.</p>

<p>But his thoughts were turned into a different
channel the next day, by a visit Maud paid to
her friend’s studio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>Phil was with Roma, watching her work, for
Michael Meredith was not yet down; and the
young man forgot, as did also Roma, the
foreign ideas of fitness of things, and assumed
an English freedom, which seemed to them
quite natural and proper under the circumstances.</p>

<p>‘I am expecting Miss Debenham for a
sitting. She promised to come this morning.
You will see then if she so resembles her
brother.’</p>

<p>Phil, so to speak, pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>‘Miss Debenham coming here?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Signor.’</p>

<p>‘May I be permitted to stay? Will she or
you think it too great an intrusion? I should
so like some converse with my old friend’s
sister.’</p>

<p>‘Maud will be delighted, I am sure. She is
the merriest girl in the world, and adores her
brother. Any friend of his will be welcome.’</p>

<p>There was the sound of a light footfall down
the long passage.</p>

<p>‘Here she is!’ said Roma.</p>

<p>Maud entered, a fair vision, in her white
dress and shady hat, with her bright eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
clear, rose-tinted skin, happy smile and ready
laugh.</p>

<p>‘Roma! Here I am, you see! Not so late
as usual. Oh, I beg your pardon. Are you
engaged?’</p>

<p>‘No; this is our friend Signor Pagliadini,
who is visiting us, and is anxious to be presented
to you. He knew your brother in
Italy.’</p>

<p>On hearing this, Maud’s face lighted up
brightly, and she held out her hand.</p>

<p>‘I am always pleased to see any friend of
my brother’s.’</p>

<p>There was an unconscious, fond pride in the
way she spoke the words ‘my brother,’ which
brought a keen sense of pain to Phil’s heart.</p>

<p>It was hard, he felt, looking into his sister’s
face, after eighteen long years of separation,
that it was but a stranger’s welcome he received,
and that its cordiality was only due to
the fact that she believed him to be Tor’s
friend.</p>

<p>He was glad that he had not to say much,
glad that she was unable to converse freely
with him, and glad that preparations for the
sitting were at once commenced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>Poor Phil was not endowed with any very
large amount of self-control, and to meet thus
his only sister, and a sister whom he had
greatly loved, was a hard task, and one which
roused in his heart all the bitterness which
had been nearly lulled to sleep.</p>

<p>Time, however, brought him calmness, and
he was soon able to listen to what the two
girls were saying, whilst he appeared to be
looking over some books of photographs.
Roma knew that he could understand, although
he could not speak English, so he was
not afraid of taking an unfair advantage of
his position.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t Phil a dear boy?’ Maud was saying,
with her usual enthusiasm. ‘He says if things
go on smoothly, he’ll take Aunt Olive and me
to Italy in the winter. Won’t that be lovely!
I do so want to travel, and I’ve never been
out of England. He would have taken us to
Switzerland this summer, only it’s too soon,
he thinks, for him to go away; and there’s my
birthday to get over, you know. But another
summer he’ll take us, and he’ll let me do
some mountaineering, he says. Won’t that be
splendid! I should love to go up Mont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
Blanc, or the Matterhorn, or some really big
mountain. I believe Phil’s done all the
hardest. He’s just the most wonderful boy
in the world.’</p>

<p>Roma let her talk on in her favourite strain,
glad to catch the animated expression such
conversation always gave to her. She wound
up by her favourite and well-worn phrase:</p>

<p>‘Isn’t he just an angel-boy, Roma?’</p>

<p>‘He is very kind and good.’</p>

<p>Maud laughed, and shook her head.</p>

<p>‘Ah, you don’t understand a bit. Lots and
lots of people might be kind and good, but
nobody could be like my Phil. I’m sure
there isn’t such another brother in all the
world. I can’t think now, however I managed
to live without him.’</p>

<p>Roma smiled at her enthusiasm. Signor
Pagliadini’s face was turned away.</p>

<p>‘It’s quite true, and you needn’t laugh.
And oh, Roma, do you know what he is
going to give me for a birthday present?’</p>

<p>‘No. What?’</p>

<p>‘A horse; a horse for my very own. Such a
little beauty! You know those at Ladywell are
all his, and are very nice; but he never gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
one to me, though I ride them just as I like.
I never thought of wanting one; but the
other day the loveliest, sweetest, most delicious
little horse appeared in one of the empty
loose boxes. I happened to see him, and
asked Phil. First he wouldn’t tell me, and
said I’d no business to play the spy; but I
coaxed and coaxed, and at last he gave in.
He said it was there on approval, and if its
paces and temper and everything else were
right, he was going to give him to me on my
birthday. He said he had been looking out
for a horse for me for a long time. He
thought I must wonder why I had not had
one before. As if I ever should!’</p>

<p>‘What did you say?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I told him he was just a darling, and
asked him why he didn’t give me the horse
I generally ride, who is quite nice in every
way.’</p>

<p>‘What did he say?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he laughed, and looked amused, and
said he didn’t mean to give away the Ladywell
horses, not even to me. I didn’t quite
see why, I said; and he told me I should
know better some day. Anyway, he’s got me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
the loveliest little horse you can imagine—bay,
with black points—and I love him ever
so much already.’</p>

<p>Shortly after this Signor Pagliadini drew
closer, and sat down near to sculptor and
model, whilst he entered into conversation.</p>

<p>Maud was ready enough to talk, and, though
a good deal of interpretation had to go on for
form’s sake, Phil felt that he was growing to
know his sister better than she imagined.</p>

<p>He was ready enough, and she eager
enough, to talk of the ‘friend Filippo,’ and
poured out so many stories of his prowess and
generosity, that poor Phil was quite dismayed
to find how he had been supplanted in Maud’s
affection, and felt that she would not readily
transfer her love to him.</p>

<p>Maud liked the dark foreigner with his
somewhat sad, appealing eyes. Some subtle
sympathy seemed to draw them together;
and, impossible as she knew it to be, she
could not help fancying she had known him
before, at some far-distant period.</p>

<p>Some of the tones of his voice and the
turns of expression made her fancy this; but
rack her brains as she would, she could find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
nothing to account for the odd idea. It was
out of the question that they ever could have
met before.</p>

<p>A servant came to say that Mr. Meredith
was down, and would be obliged if Signor
Pagliadini would join him in his study.</p>

<p>Maud gave him her hand again, as he rose to
obey the summons.</p>

<p>‘If you knew my brother once, I wish you
would come up to Ladywell this afternoon,
and have tea with us. He will be delighted,
I am sure, to renew the acquaintance.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be most happy to do so, if the
Signorina is sure I shall not intrude.’</p>

<p>‘Quite sure,’ answered Maud brightly.
‘<i>Au revoir</i>, then. Remember, you will be
expected.’</p>

<p>‘Who is he, Roma?’ she asked, when he
had gone.</p>

<p>‘A friend of an uncle of my mother’s, in
Florence. He sent him here.’</p>

<p>‘He is nice, is he not?’</p>

<p>‘I think so.’</p>

<p>‘And very good-looking?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t think who he reminds me of. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
quite bothered me whilst he was talking; not
a likeness, you know, but just a look every
now and then. Why, yes, I know now!’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘There’s a look in his eye like the picture
of papa, in Aunt Olive’s room. That’s what
it is. I’m glad I’ve remembered. I can’t
bear being puzzled like that—it’s so irritating.’</p>

<p>And so Philip Debenham was to go in
disguise to his own house, and meet, face
to face, the man who was personating him.</p>

<p>It was a trying situation certainly, and
some little cleverness and resolution was required
in the carrying out of his part.</p>

<p>Phil did not lack cleverness, but his
uncertainty and irresolution boded ill for
his wish to carry things off with a high
hand.</p>

<p>He believed Tor, warned of his visit, would
contrive to meet him alone, and of this he was
glad; and he had little fear that his disguise
would be penetrated. It was peculiarly good,
and lacked any sign of the grotesque which so
often, in such cases, defeats its own object, by
provoking suspicion and curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>He looked so completely the Italian of rank
and wealth, that he almost at times believed
himself to be what he represented; and Tor,
who <i>knew</i> that his friend was upon the open
sea, could have no reason for suspicion.</p>

<p>Phil, as has been recorded, began boldly;
but it was by a strong effort that he did so.
When he stood face to face with his old
friend his courage almost failed, and he was
only withheld by distrust and fear from tearing
off his disguise and calling out:</p>

<p>‘Tor, old fellow! Here I am! What
are you doing? and what am I to do?’</p>

<p>But he restrained himself, and spoke the
more coldly and threateningly from his very
agitation. He grew angry and desperate as
he saw how coolly and calmly Tor stood his
ground, and parried attacks which he thought
would have forced him to lay down his
arms.</p>

<p>To see this man standing before him,
assuming his name and station, and almost
scoffing at his well-aimed blows, was too
much, and Phil felt lashed into fury.</p>

<p>He charged him straight out with wronging
his friend; and then Tor gave such a bold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
fearless denial to the charge, that, in spite of
himself, Phil’s distrust was shaken. It
seemed his fate at this time to make up his
mind that Tor was a villain, only to have this
conviction shaken by some earnest assurance
or chance discovery; and then, hardly had the
balance weighed down upon the side of
friendship, before some new revelation would
wake up all the old animosity and fear.</p>

<p>Tor’s next asseveration, that he could hold
his own against the world, and would defy all
the innuendoes cast at him by anyone, was certainly
a ‘facer’ after what had gone before;
and Phil left Ladywell in as troubled and
doubtful a state as he had entered it, and
more and more convinced that Tor, with his
strong will and high hand, would be no mean
opponent, all the more dangerous for the
general enthusiasm he seemed to inspire in
others.</p>

<p>It behoved Phil to walk with great care,
and to avoid raising suspicions in the minds
of his hosts. Michael Meredith, however, was
too much absorbed in his own dreams to give
overmuch heed to what might be going on in
other people’s minds; and from him Phil could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
learn a great deal that was valuable to him,
without running any risk.</p>

<p>He heard with a sort of satisfaction, that
Tor had enemies in his supposed uncle and
aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Belassis. Now Phil knew
nothing absolutely conclusive against these
relatives of his, save that he had not liked them
as a child. His father, however, had been an
intimate friend of Belassis, and his mother had
been closely related to them.</p>

<p>Old Maynard’s letter and Maud’s, which
would have given him the clue to the real
character of his uncle, had never reached him,
and he had not the faintest idea that any
suspicion of dishonesty could attach to his
name. All he knew was that he had feared
and disliked his uncle as a boy, and had been
very indignant when he had doomed him to
an office-stool instead of bringing him up ‘as
a gentleman.’</p>

<p>Time, however, had somewhat modified this
feeling. Phil knew enough of the world now,
to be aware that a penniless youth of family
has a better chance of rising in the world by
beginning life at a merchant’s desk, than in
any capacity that he would have selected for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
himself; and he could forgive the uncle for
the choice he had made. At the same time,
he could not shake off the impression that he
had been unfairly treated by being so long
banished from home, and not allowed to see
his sister or any other relative; and he knew
that Maud had been anything but content
with her life under her uncle’s roof.</p>

<p>All these considerations rose up one by one
before him, and he could not yet say whether
or not he would take advantage of their dislike
to Tor to make allies of the Belassis’.
Instinct warned him not to trust them. Reason
told him that his wisest plan would be to get
his nearest relatives upon his side.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">hil’s</span> perplexities, however, did not
trouble him much, when once he
found himself in the quiet seclusion
of Meredith’s house.</p>

<p>Implicitly trusted by the blind man, and
liked by his daughter, Phil found himself
wonderfully at home there, and with every
hour a deeper contentment settled upon his
spirit.</p>

<p>He wandered with Roma that evening in
the dewy, moonlit garden, and neither remembered
to wonder what it was that made the
quiet hour so sweet. To neither did the
sudden intimacy which had grown up between
them seem strange. Rather it appeared as
if they had known one another all their
lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>‘Or in another life before this one, Roma,’
said Phil, as they stood looking at the stars
together. He had accidentally called her
‘Roma’ before now, and neither had observed
what seemed so natural. ‘Surely this life is
not the first. Do you not often feel that
long, long ago you have lived out a previous
existence—somewhere?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose everyone has some such feeling
from time to time,’ answered Roma dreamily.
‘Only we cannot be sure of it.’</p>

<p>‘Why do we want to be sure? Why should
we not be content to dream and to wonder?
Certainty does not bring satisfaction—rather
the reverse. Life is eternal, is it not—without
beginning and without end? We must
have lived before this. When we did so, I
am sure that you and I were very near
together. Does it not seem so to you,
Roma?’</p>

<p>She smiled a little.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it does.’</p>

<p>‘You feel it too; then there is no room for
doubt. One life has been spent side by side—shall
this one be so spent, too?’</p>

<p>The last words were little more than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
whisper. He was not sure that she had heard,
for her head was turned slightly aside.</p>

<p>‘Have you no answer?’ he asked, taking
her hand, and forcing her to look at him.</p>

<p>‘An answer?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Roma. You admit that we are not
strangers really. Love knows no dates—time
has no power over it. Days are as years,
and years as days. We have known each other
for years. You have said it yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Not quite,’ she answered gently. ‘We
were talking then of dreams and sweet fancies.
Life, Signor, is not made up of these.’</p>

<p>‘Signor!’ he repeated reproachfully. ‘How
can you be so cold? Call me Filippo.’</p>

<p>‘Filippo!’ she repeated wonderingly.</p>

<p>‘I mean Marco,’ he answered, with a confusion
which was not noticed in the darkness.
‘I was thinking of my friend whom I saw this
afternoon. Will you not call me Marco sometimes?’</p>

<p>‘I—I do not know,’ faltered Roma. ‘I
think—I think we ought not to stay here.’</p>

<p>‘Why not? Is it unpleasant to you to be
with me?’</p>

<p>‘It is not that,’ said Roma softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>‘Then we will stay,’ answered Philip, taking
her hand and placing it upon his arm. ‘Come,
let us go together to the park—Ladywell park—and
look at the moonlight through the great
trees. Your father is tired to-night, and will
be best alone. Come, you shall tell me how
you like Ladywell, and if——’</p>

<p>He pulled up there, but Roma answered
softly:</p>

<p>‘Ladywell is lovely—the loveliest place in
the world, I think.’</p>

<p>He smiled, and said half to himself:</p>

<p>‘You would be happy, then, to call it
home?’</p>

<p>Roma took her hand away, and said in a
pained voice:</p>

<p>‘Do not talk so, Signor.’</p>

<p>He understood, he thought, what she would
imply, and smiled to himself, well pleased.</p>

<p>They were now in the park, wandering amid
the chequered lights and shades of the wooded
hollows. Phil looked round him with a sense
of recollection.</p>

<p>‘Is there not a well somewhere here, Roma?—a
wishing-well?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but how do you know?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>‘I must have been here, I think, in that
former life, of which we were talking just now.
Full moon and a summer’s night—is not this
just the right time? Shall we go and wish
there together now, Roma? Surely such an
opportunity is not to be lost!’</p>

<p>She smiled an assent.</p>

<p>‘Are you superstitious, Marco?’</p>

<p>He looked at her with a glad, proud
smile.</p>

<p>‘I think I could be so to-night.’</p>

<p>Phil led the way through the woodland
path, down to the secluded well. He remembered
the path as well as if he had only
traversed it yesterday, and Roma forgot to be
surprised.</p>

<p>It was in reality a spring, this so-called
‘wishing-well:’ a clear bubbling spring, rising
up in a natural stone basin, lined with moss
and fringed with fern. A quaint stone cup
hung by a rusty iron chain beside the spring,
and round the edge of the basin a quaint inscription
was carved, stating the magic properties
of the well.</p>

<p>Phil stood looking thoughtfully into the
dimpling water, where faint reflected lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
and shadows played, and then he took the cup
and filled it.</p>

<p>‘Have you a wish ready, Roma?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Then wish and drink; for something within
tells me that the hour is favourable, and the
spirits propitious to our wishes.’</p>

<p>Roma smiled and drank, and Phil tossed the
remaining drops upon the grass in a silvery
shower, pronouncing a few mystic words.</p>

<p>‘Why so?’ asked Roma.</p>

<p>‘We always used to do it——’ there was a
momentary pause—‘in my country, at a fairy
well, which my sister and I sometimes visited
as children. But I must wish now, and the cup
must not be used twice upon the same night. I
must take the bolder course, and brave the
wrath of the spirits. Do they not say that
those who do so, gain a more generous fulfilment,
or a marked repudiation of their wish?’</p>

<p>‘How do you know?’ asked Roma again.</p>

<p>‘I suppose wishing-wells are pretty much
the same all the world over,’ he answered
lightly. ‘Anyway, I will be bold. Now
for it!’</p>

<p>He bent his head over the sparkling spring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
and took a long, deep draught. Then he
stood upright, and his face looked earnest and
steadfast.</p>

<p>‘You have wished a long wish,’ remarked
Roma, when at length he moved.</p>

<p>‘I have—a long and complex wish—so
complex that I fear even the spirits of the well
will find it hard to answer every part, even if
they try.’</p>

<p>‘You should have faith,’ said Roma, smiling.
‘To doubt them is fatal.’</p>

<p>‘Then I will not doubt,’ he answered
quickly. ‘I will believe they can accomplish
all; but they have a hard task before them!’</p>

<p>Roma looked curiously at him.</p>

<p>‘I wonder what you can have wished.’</p>

<p>‘Something concerning my own personal
history—you know we must not reveal our
wishes.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not,’ she answered seriously; but
as they lingered round the quiet spot, where
the silence was only broken by the murmuring
of the magic spring, Phil began again to speak,
and Roma fancied he was still thinking of his
complex wish.</p>

<p>‘Now I want you to give me an opinion,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
he said, ‘for I am very much perplexed.
Which should be the stronger claim upon us,
the claim of justice or that of gratitude?’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Roma. ‘It is
a hard question, as you put it.’</p>

<p>‘It is a hard question, put it as you will. I
mean just what I say. When justice urges
you to one course, and gratitude to another,
which motive should be allowed to triumph?’</p>

<p>Roma’s brow became knit by a frown of
perplexity.</p>

<p>‘It is not easy to decide without knowing
more; but I think gratitude should be held
very sacred.’</p>

<p>‘And injustice allowed to go on?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no; not quite that. Injustice can
never, never be right. It should always be
checked, if possible. Only gratitude should
not be set on one side.’</p>

<p>‘You answer by a paradox in this case.
Either gratitude or justice must be set aside.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot think but that both might be considered:
there must be some right way of
doing right—there always is. Can you not
tell me more?’</p>

<p>‘I can only tell you that one who was my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
friend, and to whom I owe much gratitude,
has now turned traitor, and done me a grievous
wrong. I must right myself before the world.
I cannot submit to be defrauded of my all, to
be made an outcast and a wanderer upon the
face of the earth; but I can only do so by bringing
disgrace upon the man I once loved well, and
to whom I certainly owe a debt of gratitude.’</p>

<p>Roma pondered deeply. It seemed a hard
case, and she scarcely knew what to advise.</p>

<p>‘Is there no middle course?’</p>

<p>‘I fear he will not accept a compromise.
What I know of his character, and what I have
heard of his actions, lead me to suppose that
he will fight to the death, and leave me no
option but to expose and disgrace him.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose you have come to England for
legal advice,’ said Roma.</p>

<p>‘Yes, and to take a calm and dispassionate
view of things. It is an unpleasant position
to be placed in, is it not?’</p>

<p>‘Very indeed.’</p>

<p>‘And have you no advice for me?’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I know so little of the world
that mine would be sadly unpractical.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps unworldly counsel might be better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
than that of the law,’ answered Phil thoughtfully.
‘Let me hear what you have to suggest,
Roma.’</p>

<p>‘Have you so quarrelled with this friend
that you could not get speech of him?’</p>

<p>‘Well—no, hardly that yet, I think; for I
have only just learnt the injury he has done
me.’</p>

<p>‘Then I think I should go back and make
him see me, and I should tell him that I did
not want to harm him, but that justice must
be done. I should say how it hurt me to have
to fight anyone who had been good to me. I
should say how grateful I still felt for his
kindness; but I should be firm, and say at the
same time, that if he <i>would</i> fight for the wrong
instead of yielding to the right, I should be
obliged to become his enemy.’</p>

<p>‘It might be a dangerous step for me to
take,’ said Phil. ‘For he is very strong.’</p>

<p>‘What course are you thinking of pursuing?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot make up my mind. A sudden
blow would be most effective.’</p>

<p>‘If he has ever been a friend to you, and if
you owe him gratitude,’ said Roma gravely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
‘you ought not to strike him unawares. You
owe it to him to be frank, even though he
may have been treacherous to you. Never
do wrong because another does it. You do
not mind my speaking out?’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed. I thank you for it, Roma; and
I will take your advice. I had almost pledged
myself to it before; now my mind is made up.
Whatever is done shall be done openly, and
my friend shall have due warning before I
strike a blow.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure you will never regret your decision,’
said Roma warmly.</p>

<p>That episode of the wishing-well made a
deep impression upon Phil and his companion.
The mutual confidences they had exchanged
seemed to draw them more closely together,
and the secret which was known only to them,
and which was to be inviolably kept, was a
link which strengthened the bond between
them.</p>

<p>‘She is a noble woman and a sweet woman,’
Phil said to himself that night. ‘I will win
her for my wife when I have my own again;
and I think she will not shrink then at the
idea of calling Ladywell her home. I can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
paving the way with the father, though my
lips are sealed at present, for I cannot give a
false name and antecedents when I plead such
a cause as that. With Roma, I cannot think
my task will be a hard one. I am sure she
is not indifferent to me. I think, too, she
must know how I love her.’</p>

<p>It was not difficult to lead Michael Meredith
to speak of his daughter. He was proud
of her, and proud of any admiration bestowed
upon her. He knew by the way in which his
guest spoke and acted, that he had from the
first been struck and impressed by Roma, and
he was pleased that it was so.</p>

<p>‘She has been my stay and solace all
through my declining years,’ said Meredith, in
his studied, artificial way.</p>

<p>‘I wonder you have kept her with you so
long,’ hazarded Phil.</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes, you may say that with reason;
but we have lived for one another, and apart
from the world. Few men have even seen
my Roma.’</p>

<p>‘Rather hard on the men,’ said Phil gallantly.</p>

<p>Meredith smiled, well pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah!’ he said, ‘but I knew my own mind.
My choice was made before.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean, Signor?’</p>

<p>‘I meant to choose her husband. Englishman
though I am, I am foreigner enough to
believe in marriages made by the parents.
But I love my child, and would not willingly
compel her fancy.’</p>

<p>Phil sat silent, and looked much taken
aback. Meredith gently wandered on, as was
his way when once started on a favourite theme.</p>

<p>‘But I find, Signor, that a steady will and
a gentle tact mould circumstances as well as
individuals. I cannot act as other men do.
I might even be held as helpless and dependent,
and yet I find I have but to sit here and
plan and <i>will</i>, and the rest follows of itself.
I could say much upon that wonderful power—the
human will.’</p>

<p>The monstrous egotism of the man passed
unheeded; but his vague hints made Phil very
uneasy.</p>

<p>‘I do not know if I have followed you,
Signor; do you mean that your will has
brought to you such a husband as you have
desired for your daughter?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>‘Circumstances have brought the man; my
will, or my child’s charms have done the rest.
I knew all would follow when he had appeared.’</p>

<p>Phil almost feared to ask the next question.</p>

<p>‘Is the Signorina, then, already betrothed?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, certainly.’</p>

<p>There was a brief pause before the next
question.</p>

<p>‘And may I ask to whom?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes; to our good friend Philip Debenham,
the master of Ladywell Manor.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’</p>

<p>‘You are surprised, it seems. Is it anything
so very strange that he should love my
child?’</p>

<p>‘Why, no—oh no—not at all; but I did
not know—I had not heard.’</p>

<p>‘No, probably not. I have not alluded to
the matter before, and young maidens do not
speak of what lies so near to their hearts.’</p>

<p>‘The Signorina is, without doubt, deeply
attached to—to Signor Debenham.’</p>

<p>‘Most deeply. It is a warm attachment on
both sides. I perceived it from the first, long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
before the young people were aware of it
themselves;’ and Mr. Meredith smiled his
quiet, satisfied smile.</p>

<p>‘They have known each other long, no
doubt?’</p>

<p>‘Not very long; but time has little to do
with such matters, as you may find out for
yourself one day, Signor. It is we elders who
think of time, and count the weeks the acquaintance
has lasted, before giving our consent.
But in this case I had no scruple. I
had loved the father—I loved and trusted the
son, and could give my daughter to him with
my blessing.’</p>

<p>‘For the sake of the father?’ said Phil, in a
strange, forced tone.</p>

<p>‘First for the father’s sake, then for his own.
No one who owns the name of Debenham can
but be dear to me.’</p>

<p>Phil mastered himself by an effort; but his
silence had not passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>‘I weary you by these personal details,
Signor,’ said Meredith courteously. ‘I forget,
in my blindness, that my little world is not
all-absorbing to others. I hear Roma’s voice
in the garden. She will prove a pleasanter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
companion than I; and I will rest awhile, as I
feel fatigued by this heat.’</p>

<p>With bitter feelings surging in his heart,
Phil left the presence of the blind man.</p>

<p>‘Is he not rightly called Jacob?’ muttered
he, in his wrath, recalling half-forgotten words
which seemed now to burn themselves into his
very brain. ‘First he takes away my birthright,
and now he takes away my blessing also.’</p>

<p>Roma was in the garden, singing softly to
herself. She sang because she was happy,
though why she was so, she did not pause to
ask herself.</p>

<p>‘Marco!’</p>

<p>The word seemed to escape her unawares,
and her face brightened into a beautiful smile
as she saw him.</p>

<p>‘Roma!’</p>

<p>He had seen the look upon her face, and
now he strode forward and seized her
hands.</p>

<p>‘Roma,’ he said abruptly, ‘I love you, and
you know it. Do you love me?’</p>

<p>He was in earnest now, so much in earnest
that all weakness and hesitancy had fled in a
moment. He was stronger than she at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
present moment, and his earnestness compelled
her to answer, and to answer truly.</p>

<p>For a moment the nominal pledge that
bound her was forgotten. Roma knew that
she was really free, and that she had given her
heart to this stranger.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Marco,’ she answered, lifting her dark
eyes fearlessly to his, ‘I love you.’</p>

<p>‘My darling—my Roma!’</p>

<p>He drew her towards him, and she did not
repulse him. Everything was for a brief
space buried in oblivion, save the one all-important
revelation that they loved one
another.</p>

<p>Phil was the first to recover himself.
After one pause of forgetfulness memory
returned.</p>

<p>‘Roma,’ he said, ‘I cannot believe my own
happiness. I have won you in a moment of
profound despair, just when I had heard from
your father’s lips that you were the promised
bride of another. How has he made so great
an error?’</p>

<p>The light died suddenly out of Roma’s face,
and her arms fell to her sides.</p>

<p>‘I had forgotten,’ she said hurriedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>‘Forgotten what?’</p>

<p>‘That I am not free—yet.’</p>

<p>‘Not free! Roma! Roma! And you have
said that you love me!’</p>

<p>‘I do love you, Marco. I cannot take back
words I have spoken; but I had no right to
speak them.’</p>

<p>‘No right!’</p>

<p>‘No; you know why—my father has told
you.’</p>

<p>‘You are betrothed to—Philip Debenham?’</p>

<p>She bent her head in a voiceless assent.</p>

<p>‘Roma!’ he cried, with pain and indignation
in his tone, ‘have you pledged your
hand without your heart? or do you love this
man?’</p>

<p>‘You know I do not,’ she answered
proudly; ‘I have told you whom I love.’</p>

<p>His face softened instantly.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, Roma. I should not have
spoken so; but indeed you gave me cause.
Let us come to your father now, and tell
him all. Tell him you pledged yourself
before you knew your own heart. We will
kneel to him to grant what we ask, and to
bless our love.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>But Roma shrank back with a frightened
look.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, no! Indeed you must not. It
would kill him!’</p>

<p>‘Kill him! He cannot care so very much.’</p>

<p>‘He does! he does! Oh, Marco! you
must have patience. If you cannot wait till
I bid you speak, we must part now and for
ever. I can die myself, but I cannot, I cannot
give him such pain!’</p>

<p>Phil gazed at her in amazement.</p>

<p>‘Roma, I cannot understand. Why should
we wait? He must be told sometime—unless,
indeed, you mean to sell yourself, and
marry——’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, no, Marco! how can you be so
cruel? I will never marry him; but I cannot
tell my father yet. You must trust me; you
must be patient.’</p>

<p>‘If only you would explain! How can
things get anything but worse by waiting? I
know Philip Debenham well, Roma. He will
hold you to your promise through everything.
He never gives way when once his
mind is made up. You stand in great
danger.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>Something in the warning tone made Roma
tremble. Had the man she had believed in
played her false? Would he hold her to her
plighted word?</p>

<p>‘Let me go in, Marco,’ she said in low,
trembling tones. ‘I am very miserable. I
don’t know what to say or what to think. I do
love you; but you must bear with me. Some
day I will tell you all; till then you <i>must</i>
keep silence. Think as kindly of me as you
can. I must speak to Philip before I can
speak to you any more of—of—love.’</p>

<p>She turned and left him, and Phil, with
a dark look on his face, turned and shook
his fist in the direction of Ladywell Manor.</p>

<p>‘Torrington Torwood,’ he said slowly
and deliberately, ‘I will make you pay for
this!’</p>

<small>THE LAST STRAW.</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/i_pi.jpg" alt="I" /></div>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">t</span> was very well for Roma to tell Phil
that he was not to speak again to
her of love; but he was not at all
prepared to submit to such a prohibition.</p>

<p>Roma loved him, and had admitted her
love, therefore he had a right to assume
towards her something of a lover’s part.</p>

<p>‘All is fair in love and war,’ he said to
himself; and he felt that against his false
friend any step he chose to take was
fair.</p>

<p>The fact that he had, by flattering the
father’s foolish vanity, obtained the promise of
the daughter’s hand against her own will,
added fuel to the fire of his anger against
Tor, which he had been able only fitfully to
keep burning so far; and he now felt that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
could proceed to severe measures with less
scruple than heretofore.</p>

<p>Roma was unhappy; he saw that plainly
through the evening hours that followed
their declaration of mutual love; and the
thought that Tor was making her suffer
was enough to rouse, and to keep stirring
within him, deep feelings of animosity and
scorn.</p>

<p>Roma need not have been unhappy; but
when a false position has been forced upon a
woman, it must sooner or later become a
trouble and an anxiety.</p>

<p>The girl had, in a great measure, forced
herself into the position she thus occupied, by
her feverish dread of agitating her father, by
the promise she had obtained from Tor, and
by her determination to sacrifice anything—her
life’s happiness, if need be—to his whims,
which in her eyes were sacred.</p>

<p>It had seemed to her a trifling thing, this
sacrifice, so long as no love had ever entered
her life, save her love towards her blind
father. She would even have made a loveless
marriage rather than have given him pain, for
she wrongly believed that her one duty in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
life was to shield him, at all cost, from any
kind of trouble.</p>

<p>But the events of the past few days had insensibly
wrought a change in her. She saw
now that the sacrifice of her life would involve
deep pain to another; and in the light of this
new love a hundred doubts and fears, which
had never troubled her before, now woke into
active being.</p>

<p>Foremost amongst these was the haunting
dread which Phil’s warning had aroused.
Would this man to whom she was pledged
really give her back her word? Or had he
been deceiving her?</p>

<p>She had never doubted Tor before, and she
certainly need not have doubted him now;
but if love brings with it a thousand bright
hopes, it as certainly brings quite as many
nervous fears.</p>

<p>Phil had unconsciously infected her with
some of his own distrust of the man who
passed as master of Ladywell, and she began to
tremble lest he had deceived her, as the Signor
said he had deceived others before. She tried
to rid herself of these thoughts, she always
spoke on behalf of ‘Mr. Debenham’ when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
was attacked, yet the cold fear which had
clutched at her heart would not relax its grip.</p>

<p>She had seen very little of Tor lately,
which partly accounted for this change in her
feelings. There was something straightforward
and kindly in his presence, that
always gave her confidence, and would have
driven away her fears had she but seen him
frequently face to face; but of late he had
had much to occupy his time and thoughts,
and he felt it well, under existing circumstances,
to see but little of Roma.</p>

<p>True, not many days had passed since he
had paid a hurried visit to her studio; but
that did not count for much, and it seemed to
her a long, long while since they had spoken
together of their mutual understanding respecting
their nominal engagement.</p>

<p>The girl’s heart was heavy, and her face was
pale when she met their guest at the breakfast-table
upon the following day.</p>

<p>Phil saw this, and indignation waxed hot
within him.</p>

<p>That morning Roma declined to allow him
to enter her studio. She wanted, she said, to
work hard, and should do so better alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>Phil walked across the park to Ladywell,
and wandered aimlessly about in its grounds
and gardens, thinking bitter thoughts of his
strange and anomalous position—a trespasser
and an alien upon his own property.</p>

<p>He saw no one but a few gardeners, who
looked curiously at him, but made no remark
upon his presence there. He wandered at will
amongst the flowers and shrubs, remarking to
himself upon the beautiful order which reigned
there, and wondering whether under his rule—if
ever he obtained his own—things would
be as well kept up.</p>

<p>‘Tor always was made to rule—I used to
tell him so: now perhaps he has found it out
for himself, and has learned his own power.’</p>

<p>Phil was in a depressed frame of mind, restless
and angry, yet still irresolute, from the
feeling of helplessness which always came over
him when he pictured himself standing up
against Tor.</p>

<p>‘He can turn me round his little finger,’
said poor Phil dismally enough. ‘He can do
anything he likes with me, and he knows it.
I believe if he had me to deal with, and only
me, he could almost persuade me that I was Torwood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
and he Debenham. I know the old feeling
would all come back, and I should be like
a child in his hands. I must have some help.
I must make allies somehow. I wonder what
these Belassis people are like. After all, they
are my next of kin.’</p>

<p>Phil gathered a great bunch of roses and
heliotrope for Roma, and then slowly turned
his steps back to the house.</p>

<p>‘My flowers!’ he thought bitterly. ‘I have
to steal my own flowers, and run the risk of
being prosecuted for it.’</p>

<p>No harm, however, resulted from his boldness.
He met nobody as he retreated with his
fragrant burden; only as he crossed the park,
under the shadow of the great trees, he saw
Maud and Tor riding gaily over the elastic
sward up to the great terrace.</p>

<p>‘What a handsome couple they are!’ thought
Phil. ‘And how fond she is of him! I wonder
what she will say when I have brought him to
ignominy and disgrace. Will that steel her
heart against me? I don’t believe women have
any sense of justice when their pity is aroused.’</p>

<p>He found Roma alone in the room, where
the cloth was laid for lunch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, how lovely!’ she exclaimed, as she saw
the flowers.</p>

<p>‘For you,’ he said softly. ‘You know,
Roma, what the heliotrope says?’</p>

<p>She bent her head over the flowers, and
answered nothing.</p>

<p>‘Tell me,’ he said, with that gentle authority
which a man in his position seldom assumes in
vain.</p>

<p>‘“<i>Ich liebe dich</i>,”’ she answered so softly
that he, too, had to bend towards her flowers
to catch the words.</p>

<p>Next moment they had started apart, for
Mr. Meredith had entered the room with a
lady upon his arm, the sight of whose face
made Phil start with surprise.</p>

<p>He knew at a glance who she was—his aunt,
Mrs. Belassis.</p>

<p>Eighteen years had passed since he had
seen her, but yet that handsome, cold face,
with its hard lines and clearly cut features,
had not been effaced from his recollection;
and time had wrought little change in Mrs.
Belassis.</p>

<p>Phil felt repelled by the face, though he
tried not to let himself be too much led by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
instinct of distrust. He had that gift of a
somewhat finely strung nature, of reading
faces with tolerable accuracy, and yet he did
not wish to dislike or suspect Mrs. Belassis.
She might prove a useful ally, and he was
anxious not to allow prejudice to warp his
judgment.</p>

<p>He talked with a purpose at table, and in a
moment he saw that she understood and responded.
It needed but a short time to convince
him that Mrs. Belassis was a clever
woman, and that she had some suspicions
of her own respecting the character of her
supposed nephew: though in what channel
her suspicions ran, it was not the time and
place then to discover.</p>

<p>Opportunity, however, was not long wanting,
for an offer of escort home gave him the
chance to speak to his aunt alone, and find out,
if possible, what it was she really thought
respecting Tor.</p>

<p>The interview was not entirely satisfactory,
for, do what he would, Phil could not shake
off the old distrust of his aunt; and the idea
of plotting against Tor with a Belassis was so
repugnant to all the instincts of his nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
that he could not bring himself to speak out
plainly.</p>

<p>He saw that Mrs. Belassis was upon the
wrong tack in her suspicions. She had no
idea, as yet, of the trick that had been played
upon the family; and Phil had, therefore, the
acuteness to wonder how it was she so hated
Tor, as to be willing to ally herself against him,
and that with a perfect stranger. She must
have a motive, and an interested one, else she
would not trouble herself over the matter.
What was it to her if Mr. Torwood was
wronged? It was no business of hers to
arbitrate between two friends.</p>

<p>So he plucked up his courage and put the
question, and learned by the answer that Tor
had treated with contumely his next of
kin.</p>

<p>He could not help inwardly rejoicing that
the Belassis faction had been so treated, for
his soul abhorred them, even whilst his reason
tried to persuade him into taking them into
his confidence.</p>

<p>How he would have answered Mrs. Belassis
he never had to decide; for as she finished
her tirade against her ungrateful nephew, Tor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
himself came striding down the lane, and Phil
felt himself crimsoning all over.</p>

<p>Suppose Tor could know him! Fancy such
a juxtaposition! Phil in league with a Belassis
against his old friend!</p>

<p>A sudden sense of shame fell upon him, as
he met for an instant the keen, quick glance
from Tor’s eyes. There was no guilt, no
shame in Tor’s face; but the frank, open
courage and truthfulness which had always
characterized it.</p>

<p>No, come what might, he could not plot
against his friend. He would speak to him
openly, face to face. Phil’s better angel was now
in the ascendant, and he bid Mrs. Belassis a
hasty adieu, whilst some words she had uttered,
which had passed almost unnoticed before, now
recurred to him with considerable significance.</p>

<p>‘Spends Mr. Torwood’s money almost more
freely than his own,’ he muttered in French;
and then he added in vigorous English, ‘The
deuce he does!’</p>

<p>Phil pondered over this piece of intelligence
a good deal. So Tor was spending his own
money freely. Spending his own meant saving
Phil’s. If he was saving Phil’s, what could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
his object? Why should he save it, if he
looked upon it as his own, and meant to claim
it as such? Was it caution? or was it
honesty? What could be the reason for
economizing money supposed to be his own?</p>

<p>Phil puzzled over this question without
solving the problem to his own satisfaction.
On the whole, he inclined to believe that Tor
was acting more fairly towards him than he
had once believed; and yet he could not see
his way out of the difficulty, nor understand
how it was possible for his friend to be anything
but false and treacherous.</p>

<p>He hung about Ladywell as a moth flits
about a candle: it fascinated him to watch, as
far as possible, the life that went on there;
and yet the more he watched the more he
saw how strong was Tor’s position, and the
more did he fear the result of trying to oust
him.</p>

<p>‘What would be the good to me of house
and lands, if my sister hated me, and my aunt—the
only aunt I care about—feared and
blamed me? I should be detested at Ladywell,
I know, if Tor were in prison. They will
never love me as they do him. Maud is just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
wrapped up in him. Even Roma might turn
against me then. Though she does not love
him, she would pity him, and as everybody
knows, pity is akin to love.’</p>

<p>It never occurred to Phil that Tor might be
as much wrapped up in Maud, as Maud was in
him, and the idea of his being in love with
her never so much as entered his head. As
he had been told that he was engaged to
Roma, this was perhaps natural. As her heart
was not concerned in the matter, his must be;
otherwise the engagement could never have
been formed.</p>

<p>The next event that followed was an invitation
to dine at Ladywell.</p>

<p>This invitation Phil accepted readily. He
was not now at all nervous of being detected,
and his interest in that household was most
absorbing.</p>

<p>Tor, in giving the invitation, had implied
that it was merely a friendly dinner he was
asked to share, that no company would be invited;
and he thought that perhaps some opportunity
would arise which would give him
that private interview which he longed for
whilst he dreaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>When he reached the drawing-room he
found two strange ladies there, as well as Maud
and Mrs. Lorraine. One was a young girl of
blooming countenance, the other a handsome,
keen-eyed, well-dressed elderly lady, whose
name was given as Miss Marjory Descartes.</p>

<p>Phil fancied the name was not altogether
strange to him. He had a vague idea that he
had heard it before, and that in some way or
another it was associated with Tor; but he
could not find the clue to the dim train of
thought aroused, and as dinner was announced,
his duty of conducting Maud to the head of
her table now occupied his mind to the exclusion
of all else.</p>

<p>Maud was very charming and very winning,
of that there could be no doubt; and the
more so from the little difficulties which arose
in making herself understood to her neighbour.
Her French was more broken and pretty than
fluent, but her bright smiles and speaking
gestures quite made up for lack of words; and
Phil was more and more delighted with his
sister, and more and more impatient to claim
her as his own.</p>

<p>He noticed, even when in company and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
entertaining guests at her table, how her eyes
were turning continually to Tor, how her face
lighted when their glances met, and how she
tried to catch what he said, and to include
him in her own talk.</p>

<p>‘How she does love him!’ thought poor
Phil. ‘Will she ever love me like that? I
should so hate to do anything to make her
shrink from me. I will say nothing to-night,
at any rate.’</p>

<p>This decision was a relief, and the short
interval that he spent <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Tor,
passed more easily than might have been expected.
Phil concealed the nervousness he
felt, and Tor seemed always at his ease. The
interview did not last long, for they soon rose
by mutual consent, to join the ladies.</p>

<p>Phil was glad to escape from his host, and
fell readily into conversation with Miss Marjory
Descartes, who attracted him by her
bright, pleasant manner, and by her fluent,
amusing speech.</p>

<p>But he was not altogether easy as the conversation
proceeded. He could not define the
impression produced; but he certainly experienced
some sensation which suggested the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
idea that he was being ‘turned inside out’
for Miss Marjory’s inspection.</p>

<p>If it was so, it was so cleverly done that
he was barely conscious of the operation. It
might be all his morbid fancy, he told himself.
Miss Marjory could not by any chance know
anything. Tor would know better than to
betray his own secret. Still he could not be
quite comfortable, and the more he reviewed
the talk afterwards, the less he liked it.</p>

<p>He had committed himself, he feared, more
than he had intended, and had not been clear
as to his antecedents under cross-examination.
He had come without a properly prepared
story, and Miss Marjory had either found
it out, or might have done so, if she had
had any motive in her apparently innocent
queries.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory had half fascinated, half
frightened him.</p>

<p>He could not rid himself of the idea that
she was in some way an ally of Tor’s, and in
his confidence. If so, it boded ill for him, for
he knew that a clever woman was a dangerous
enemy; and what Miss Marjory had said of
Tor’s likeness to Mr. Debenham and Maud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
seemed to imply that if an ally, she would be
an unscrupulous one.</p>

<p>Such remarks as hers must have been made
in all simplicity, or else with a deep motive.
Phil was inclined to believe the latter theory;
though at times he accused himself of morbid
fears, which led him to suspect danger where
no danger was.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture of affairs, came the invitation
to join the dinner-party that was to
celebrate Maud’s majority. Michael Meredith,
in his presumption that he and Roma almost
belonged to the family, had all but asked for
an invitation, and Tor had given it, including,
as was almost necessary, the Signor.</p>

<p>At almost the last moment, after all, Meredith
and his daughter decided against going,
as his health was not considered strong enough
to bear the fatigue. The Signor, however, to
everyone’s surprise, announced his intention
of holding to his accepted word; and nobody
exactly liked to say to him that his presence
would be rather an intrusion. Roma had
told him beforehand something about Mr.
Debenham’s odd will, and the decision Maud
was expected to make. He was interested, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
having no suspicions about the validity of the
will, nor even of any compulsion put upon the
father in its making, he did not attach the
same significance to the matter that others
had done.</p>

<p>Phil never forgot that dinner.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life he sat down to
dine with a family party, and saw, for the first
time since he had grown up, the three cousins
he had played and quarrelled with as a child,
and the uncle whom as a child he had so
cordially hated. He did not now look in any
way lovable. Phil could well believe that
youthful impressions had been correct.</p>

<p>It was rather a terrible dinner for Phil. He
could not disguise the interest with which he
listened to the conversation that went on;
and then Miss Marjory turned upon him, told
him he was not an Italian, and asked why he
could not say straight out who he was and
what he had come for.</p>

<p>Phil had not a word to say, and for awhile
sat dumb and confounded; but even a worm
will turn, and he felt that he must do so. He
tried to attack Miss Marjory, and find out
what she did know; but he was defeated at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
all points. He was no match for his opponent;
and all he could find out was, that he was
known to be a spy, and, even if his identity
was not guessed at, the object of his visit was;
and that every means would be taken to defeat
him, and to upset the claim he was about to
put forward.</p>

<p>The enemy was even so strong that he was
warned on his own account to desist, and
plainly told that an attempt to coerce ‘Mr.
Debenham’ would only recoil upon his own
head.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory undertook to defeat him
single-handed, and such was the respect inspired
by her indomitable will and aggressive,
confident manner, that Phil almost believed
his cause already lost.</p>

<p>Like one in a dream he made his way to
the library, where Maud’s decision was to be
heard. He resented Tor’s attempt to exclude
him as a personal affront. Who had the best
right to be there, the brother, or the brother’s
friend?</p>

<p>Phil listened to all that passed with a
feverish interest, not taking in its full significance,
but observing only what he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
might be afterwards useful to himself. He
saw that Tor had made bitter enemies of the
Belassis’, husband and wife, and knew that
they would now support him, heart and soul,
in his claim to wrest his own from the hand
of their foe.</p>

<p>Very willingly did he now agree with Mrs.
Belassis that the time had come to put an
end to the game, and ready enough was he to
meet her upon the morrow to discuss their
campaign.</p>

<p>But then, again, when they had met face
to face, he could not quite make up his mind
to be frank. He despised the tools he had
brought himself to employ, and was ready to
hate himself for stooping to use them.</p>

<p>He did betray the secret, half unwittingly,
and gave the clue of the tangle into his
aunt’s hands; but he let her believe that
Philip Debenham was away at sea, for not
yet was he prepared to give her his full confidence.</p>

<p>Their conversation has already been given;
they nearly came to an understanding more
than once; and then Phil, with instinctive distrust,
pulled up, and would not commit himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
further; but he knew that he had betrayed
too much for it to be possible any longer to
keep the game in his own hands; and that, if
his promise to Tor were to be redeemed, he
must see and speak to him without delay.</p>

<p>He was to go to Ladywell as a guest next
day. Nothing could be done before then, he
thought, by Mrs. Belassis; yet, as he approached
the door on his way to the Manor House, he encountered
her coming forth.</p>

<p>‘They <i>will</i> dispute it,’ she said, in a hurried
whisper. ‘He means to keep the name and
position he has assumed. Try your power if
you will; but his mind is made up.’</p>

<p>Phil went slowly up to the house.</p>

<p>‘I must try my power. I will. There is
no other course open to me now. Whatever
may be the result, I must make myself
known. I will demand an interview this
very night. I am glad that I cannot hesitate
longer, that things have gone beyond my
control. What will he say? How will he
take it? Shame and fear and anger I must
see, but oh! how strange they will look
when stamped upon his face! Oh, Tor, Tor!
why have you done this thing?’</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">ignor Pagliadini</span>, on saying
good-night to the company assembled
at Ladywell, demanded
a private interview with the master of the
house.</p>

<p>Phil watched his host’s face closely whilst
he made known his wish, and saw that an
expression of uneasiness passed over it,
although Tor’s manner was as frank and
pleasant as possible.</p>

<p>He saw, too, a sharp look of inquiry in
Miss Marjory’s keen eyes, and felt more than
ever convinced that this dangerous little
woman was the confidante and accomplice of
his former friend.</p>

<p>But every moment now was of value to him,
and he could not linger to watch or think.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
He had a good ten minutes’ start of his
host, and he meant to make the most of
it.</p>

<p>Dashing up to his own room, he locked the
door, and flung off the dark, Italian-looking
wig, leaving exposed to view his own dusky-brown
hair, which was so like Maud’s in
colour and growth. Then out came a sharp
razor, and after five minutes’ rapid shaving
the black, Vandyke beard had vanished, and
the heavy moustache, with its long, pointed
ends, was reduced to the ordinary dimensions
accorded to Phil’s.</p>

<p>Next, the padded coat was discarded, and
an old blue smoking-jacket donned, which
displayed the true proportions of the slightly-built
figure. Some colourless fluid from a
stoppered bottle removed a little of the intense
blackness from eyebrows and moustache,
and robbed the face and hands of some of
their olive tinting; and Phil, glancing at
himself in the glass, saw that, save for the
slight swarthiness of complexion that could
not be at once removed, his old self was
entirely restored. The transformation was
complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>Then he unlocked the door, and waited
with a beating heart for the arrival of his
host. He could not decide how to meet him,
nor what to say; he could not even think connectedly,
so great was his excitement and
agitation now that the supreme moment had
come, when he and his false, treacherous
friend should stand for the first time face to
face.</p>

<p>There was a firm footfall outside, a hand
was laid upon the handle of the door; Phil
stood still in the middle of the room, and
gave permission to enter.</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>‘Now, Signor——’</p>

<p>There was a sudden pause, and for ten
seconds utter silence reigned in the room.</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Phil!</span>’ shouted Tor; and with one stride
he had reached his friend and grasped him by
both hands, in a strong, warm clasp that
seemed as if it would never relax. ‘Phil himself,
by all that’s wonderful! Phil it is, by the
powers! though how you got here passes my
comprehension! Phil, my dear old fellow, I
can’t tell you how thankful I am to see you.
Oh, this is glorious!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>With an almost boyish gesture of delight
Tor flung Phil’s hands from him, and walked
round and round him with a laugh of intense
appreciation.</p>

<p>Phil stood aghast. He had pictured this
meeting day by day for weeks, and never in
the wildest flights of his imagination had he
heard himself greeted thus.</p>

<p>Tor did not even observe his friend’s silence
in his own gladness of heart.</p>

<p>‘Phil, you rascal, tell me how you came
here? How did you escape from your vessel
without my knowledge? I can’t conceive how
you came, but it’s such an immense relief to
have you back that I don’t care for anything
else. Did that Italian fellow smuggle you in?
By-the-bye, where is he?’</p>

<p>Tor looked round him with a comical air of
perplexity; and then, seeing the coat and wig
lying on the bed, and the shaving apparatus
upon the washstand, the true meaning of the
situation dawned upon him.</p>

<p>He sprang upon Phil, and smacked him
upon the back with all the force of his strong
right arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>‘Phil, you scamp! you don’t mean to say
it was you all the time!’</p>

<p>And then he flung himself into a chair, and
laughed till the tears stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>Phil stood gazing at him, feeling more and
more like one who dreams, not knowing what
to say, or what line of conduct to assume.</p>

<p>‘You young villain!’ cried Tor, as soon as
he could speak, and he shook his fist at Phil
with an expression that defies description.
‘You young villain! you dare play me such a
trick as that! You deserve to be hung, drawn,
and quartered; and I’d string you up in two
seconds if I weren’t so glad to see you back.
What have you got to say for yourself, you
scamp!—worrying honest folks almost out of
their senses with your dark sayings and
sinister looks? And to think it was Phil
Debenham all the time! Ye gods! What
will Miss Marjory say? I shall be a laughing-stock
to her for evermore. Phil, you rascal,
I’ll never forgive you!’</p>

<p>And Tor laughed again more heartily than
before; and after a long effort at dignified
composure and coldness, old habit triumphed,
and Phil’s gravity gave way. He sat down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
opposite Tor and laughed with him until both
were fairly tired.</p>

<p>‘Tor, old man,’ he said at last, ‘I can’t
understand things yet; but it’s borne in upon
me that I’ve been a most infernal fool.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a way you have, dear boy, when left
to your own devices,’ answered Tor genially.
‘I’d never have believed you could have
played any game long, which I shouldn’t detect;
but how could I guess, when I believed
you safe on board the <i>Medusa</i>? I can’t make
out how you did it, nor why. Phil, my boy,
if you only knew how I’ve longed for you,
and worried myself nearly into a fever, you’d
never be able to say enough of my goodness
and generosity! Why did you keep me a
moment longer in such a position than was
necessary? I should feel inclined to shake
the life out of you, only this makes up for
everything.’</p>

<p>‘Tor,’ said Phil, ‘I’ve been such a consummate
ass that I don’t know how to tell you.’</p>

<p>‘Let’s come downstairs and smoke,’ said
Tor. ‘I’m sure we shan’t have done talking
this side midnight. I’ll mix some whisky
punch, and we’ll make a night of it. I’ll do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
the honours of your house for this one night,
old boy; and to-morrow, thank goodness, I’ll
resume my own personality and my humble
name. Phil,’ and he seized his friend’s hand
and shook it nearly off, ‘you can’t have a
notion how glad I am to see you again!’</p>

<p>They went down to Tor’s ‘den.’ On the
way thither, Tor took the opportunity to slip
a piece of folded paper under Miss Marjory’s
door.</p>

<p>The paper bore these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘It’s all right. Phil has come back. Look
out for larks to-morrow morning.—T. T.’</p>
</div>

<p>‘What a comfort it is to sign one’s own
name again!’ he thought, as he wrote the two
T’s.</p>

<p>‘This is like old times,’ said Tor, a quarter
of an hour later, as the two sat together
with pipes and punch. ‘Well, Phil, how do
you feel in your capacity as monarch of all
you survey? Are you as glad to reign as I
am to abdicate?’</p>

<p>‘I may like it in time, when I don’t feel
such an egregious fool as I do now,’ remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Phil, as he smoked his pipe and looked at
Tor, whose face expressed a sublime satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘Well, what is it you’ve done?’ asked the
other. ‘You’d better make a clean breast of
it, as it seems so to weigh upon your mind.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you guess?’</p>

<p>‘I should be sorry to try. There are a vast
variety of ways in which a man can make a
fool of himself, and you always had a special
aptitude in doing so.’</p>

<p>‘Do be serious, Tor. You’ll be serious
enough when you hear.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I? I don’t feel overwhelmed with
gravity so far. I can’t get over the fact that
you really made a fool of me, for once. To
think that you and Signor Pagliadini were one
and the same, and that you could meet me
time after time, and I not find you out! I
shall never be able to look Miss Marjory in
the face again!’</p>

<p>And Tor broke anew into laughter.</p>

<p>‘You’re incorrigible, Tor!’ cried Phil. ‘I
must tell you, if you can’t see for yourself. I
came in disguise because I was afraid to come
otherwise.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>‘Afraid!’ laughed Tor; ‘that’s good. Afraid
of what?’</p>

<p>‘Of you.’</p>

<p>‘Of me! Good heavens! why?’</p>

<p>‘Now just be serious a moment, and put
yourself in my place. I knew you had adopted
my name, passed yourself off as my great-uncle’s
heir, and obtained possession of Ladywell.
What could I think but that you intended
to keep it?’</p>

<p>‘Keep it!’ shouted Tor; ‘keep Ladywell!
Be Phil Debenham all the rest of my natural
life! No, thank you, my boy; not at any
price! My dear old fellow, you never were
very practical or very wise; but you don’t
mean to tell me you thought such a deception
as that would be possible for any length of
time?’</p>

<p>‘I did,’ said Phil. ‘I suppose I was an ass
for my pains. Perhaps my head was stupider
than usual, but I thought it could be done,
and that you could do it, if you had a mind.’</p>

<p>Tor opened his great grey eyes, and looked
steadily at Phil.</p>

<p>‘And did you think I had the mind?’</p>

<p>‘What could I think? You had got possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
of all that was mine. Why should you
take it if you didn’t mean to keep it?’</p>

<p>‘Of course you couldn’t understand why I
should take such a step, without seeing some
of the papers I must show you, now that you
have come back; but Phil, have we lived ten
years together, and known each other since
childhood, and have you so little confidence in
me as that?’</p>

<p>Phil’s eyes fell.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I’ve been an awful fool—a fool
and a brute both. I ought to have known.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Phil, you ought to have known. I’m
not a saint, as you know, and I’ve never set
up for being better than my fellow-men; but
I don’t think I’ve ever given you cause to
think me a blackguard. Could you really
believe in cold blood, that I should deliberately
set about to rob you of your inheritance?’</p>

<p>‘Old fellow, I’m awfully sorry. It must
have been that sunstroke that muddled me.
Don’t be in a rage—don’t cast me off. If you
only knew how I feel now, you would see how
much I am to be pitied.’</p>

<p>Tor smiled. He could not be angry with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Phil—with the man who would always be a
boy to him, whose oracle and king he had
ever been, and whose allegiance could never
be seriously shaken.</p>

<p>‘You deserve a thorough good licking for
being such a confounded muff; but you never
do get your deserts in the way of chastisement.
Phil, I have answered, and would answer, for
your trust in me with my life; and <i>you</i> could
believe this of me—you, my chosen companion
and comrade—mine own familiar friend.’</p>

<p>‘I have been punished,’ said Phil slowly.
‘I have not distrusted you without more pain
than you can easily imagine. Can you forgive
it and forget it?’</p>

<p>‘To be sure. We will only think of the
comic side of the question, for it is infinitely
comic. After all, you had cause for bewilderment—only
you might have trusted me. Come,
Phil, tell me your tale. I can’t still understand
how you escaped without my hearing of it.’</p>

<p>So Phil told, graphically enough, the story
of his awakening.</p>

<p>‘The little wretch—so he played me false!’
cried Tor, as Dr. Schneeberger’s share in the
conspiracy became known. ‘I’d have sworn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
he was too deeply buried in the human brain
to have risen to any kind of conspiracy. Why
couldn’t he have kept his word to me? I
should like to punch his head so well, that his
own brain should become an object of immediate
solicitude.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t abuse him too much,’ said Phil. ‘He
was loyal to you until I painted you so black
that he couldn’t well trust in you. When he
was won over, he made a famous ally. It was
he who devised the fiction of the sea-voyage,
so as to account for my absence from his roof,
should you chance to come over.’</p>

<p>Tor’s eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>‘Phil, you villain!’ he said slowly, ‘you
don’t mean to say you had come to your senses
that last time I saw you in Germany?’</p>

<p>Phil looked at him, smiling deprecatingly.</p>

<p>‘Well, that beats all! What a confounded
ass you were not to have it out, then and
there!’</p>

<p>‘I would have done so, if you had only called
me “Phil.” Why did <i>you</i> keep up the fiction,
Tor?’</p>

<p>‘I—I like that! As if I could possibly be
two people at once, or betray myself to anyone!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
As if I wasn’t playing a risky enough
game as it was, for the sake of your interests,
without being expected to let others see what
I was at. <i>I was</i> Phil Debenham when I went
to Germany. You were Tor. A nice thing it
would have been if I had gone and reversed
positions!’</p>

<p>‘But why were you Phil, and why was I
Tor? and why were you so bold and defiant
when I—Signor Pagliadini—told you that you
were Torwood? It was enough to make anybody
believe you meant to hold what you had
got. Miss Marjory Descartes as good as told
me that you would fight to the death.’</p>

<p>‘Phil, you are a greater fool than I took
you for! What else could I say or do until
you came to claim your own? So long as you
remained insensible and beyond my reach, I
had to stick to my story like grim death; or
I should have had the Belassis faction at my
throat, and should have tasted all the sweets
of prosecution for forgery and fraud.’</p>

<p>‘Good heavens, Tor! What a risk you ran!’</p>

<p>‘I did; and if I’d half realized the risk, I
doubt if I should ever have run it, even for
your sake.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>‘For my sake!’</p>

<p>‘Yes; you don’t suppose I’ve put myself in
a false position, and nearly got myself into a
convict’s cell, for my own amusement?’</p>

<p>‘But what good could it do me?’</p>

<p>Tor rose, unlocked a drawer, and took out
two letters: one from old Maynard, and one
from Maud.</p>

<p>‘Read those,’ he said briefly; ‘perhaps then
you will understand better.’</p>

<p>Phil read in silence, and looked up at Tor
for further enlightenment.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Well? Can’t you see? These letters and
the lawyer’s, which you have seen, came whilst
you were hopelessly insensible. Here was the
lawyer, urging immediate return of the heir;
Maud, begging and imploring her brother to
come and release her from an uncongenial
home. There were hints that Belassis was not
to be trusted in the management of the estate,
that you ought at once to come and take
matters into your own hands. Then there
was this marriage of Maud’s to stop. You
see how old Maynard wrote—and he wrote
with sense as well as cynicism; and the important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
birthday was said to be imminent,
though the date was not revealed. It seemed
most urgent that some one should go over and
look to things; and there were you, lying like
a log, and with every probability of remaining
in that state for weeks, perhaps for longer.
You could not act yourself, you could not even
empower me to act. If I had gone over as
your friend, I should have had no power; and
Belassis, as next of kin, lawyer, executor,
guardian (under your father’s will, I mean),
would have had all his own way. For aught
I knew, before you recovered, Maud would
have been bullied into marrying his son; and
you might have fallen so completely into his
power, that he would serve you as he has
served your father.’</p>

<p>Phil looked impressed and interested.</p>

<p>‘You thought all that?’</p>

<p>‘I did. You know what we have always
said of Belassis between ourselves. I distrusted
him then, though without the same
ground, no less than I do now that I have
had the honour of his acquaintance. I don’t
know what first put the notion into my head.
It seemed to come all in a moment; and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
first, I confess, my chief thought was that it
would be a fine practical joke to play upon
your people, just to personate you until you
could come over and take up the <i>rôle</i> yourself.
I knew nobody had seen you since you were a
small boy, and I felt that I could play the part
quite naturally and well for a few weeks, and
rather enjoyed the idea of being the first to
bring Belassis to see that his power had reached
its zenith. I felt that that task would come
easier to me than to you, old chap.’</p>

<p>Phil nodded.</p>

<p>‘Go on. I begin to see.’</p>

<p>‘I should hope you do. Well, I’ve about
told you all now. Of course, once the irrevocable
step taken, I began to see that it was
something more than a joke; and I had to be
very careful to leave no clue which could tell
against me, in case a suspicion were raised. I
believed every precaution had been taken, for
that <i>you</i> would ever turn against me, never
once entered my head, and even then I should
not have thought you clever enough to overturn
all my carefully laid plans. I had got
on very well, on the whole, and weathered
several threatened storms before you turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
up; but, when you appeared, I knew there
was danger ahead, and I sent for my only ally
and confidante, Miss Marjory Descartes. I
think she gave you a taste of her tongue on
one or two occasions, did she not?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, she scared me half out of my senses.
Who is she, Tor?’</p>

<p>‘An old friend of my father’s—a very clever
woman. You will like her, Phil.’</p>

<p>‘If she doesn’t make me nervous. How
came you to confide in her, Tor?’</p>

<p>‘I had to; she gave me no choice. She knew
me from my likeness to my father; but I never
regretted it; she has taken my part boldly.’</p>

<p>‘She has. You ought to make her Mrs.
Torwood.’</p>

<p>‘I might do worse, if I were thirty years
older; but, Phil, old fellow, my young affections
are bespoken elsewhere.’</p>

<p>‘I know.’</p>

<p>And poor Phil’s face clouded suddenly.</p>

<p>‘Do you? You have sharp eyes if you do.
Think, Phil, what I have had to put up with
for your sake—to pretend to be her brother
all the time, and dispassionately to await her
acceptance or rejection of other suitors. It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
not many men who would have been so
patient as I have been.’</p>

<p>‘What are you talking about?’ cried Phil
eagerly. ‘Whom is it you want to marry?’</p>

<p>‘Maud—my sister up till to-night—your
sister henceforward, thank goodness! Have
you any objection?’</p>

<p>‘Maud!’ cried Phil ecstatically. ‘Maud, is
it? Oh, Tor, old fellow, what could be more
to my mind? Oh, if I had only known!
And I have been so madly jealous, thinking it
was Roma!’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ and Tor’s eyes suddenly opened
wide. ‘So you and Roma have fallen a prey
to one another, have you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, we understand one another; but she
tells me, and her father tells me, she is engaged
to you.’</p>

<p>‘Roma knows that it is merely a fiction,
our engagement, just to humour her father,
who was very ill when he desired our betrothal—too
ill to bear the irritation of a
refusal. She could not explain this, but she
knows it, and has, I hope, bestowed upon you
the affections which certainly have never been
mine. She will be glad enough, and so shall I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
to be released from the bond. I am more
tired than I can express of the continual
fetter of a false position.’</p>

<p>‘But Mr. Meredith——’</p>

<p>‘He will not care, the old egotist! It was
not me at all whom he wanted for his
daughter; it was your father’s son. He has
always flattered his stupid old self that his
will would bring about such a marriage. Now
that you, the real son, have opportunely fallen
in love with Roma, all will be well. He will
transfer his affections, and those of his
daughter, to you with perfect equanimity, and
wonder the more at the magic power of his
will. He is an old fool, but he is blind, and
her father, so we must bear with him; but
you need not fear opposition in that
quarter.’</p>

<p>Phil drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>‘Tor,’ he said, ‘yesterday I never thought
I could be so happy as this again. If only
I hadn’t been such a brute as to doubt
you!’</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s over now, and won’t be likely to
occur again; this makes up for all. Tomorrow,
Phil, we’ll go over the accounts together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and you’ll see that I’ve not robbed
you. I’ve spent a few hundreds of the money
you were supposed to owe me, and a good deal
of my own; but with yours I’ve merely kept
the house going, and defrayed the expenses
which you would have incurred in any case.
I’ve quite turned into a business man, under
stress of circumstances, and you’ll find all as
plain as a pikestaff. You’ll never keep accounts
like that yourself, my boy, not if you live till
Doomsday. And now I can look the whole
world in the face, and snap my fingers at the
whole of the Belassis party. They’re on the
right scent now, and, but that we shall forestall
them, might be nasty; but they are
helpless so long as you stand by me, Phil, and
say that all I have done has your sanction
and approval. I suppose I may count on so
much—eh, old boy?’</p>

<p>There was so much to say, now that the
friends had once come together, so many
jokes to enjoy together, so many episodes to
laugh over, that it was two in the morning
before they separated.</p>

<p>Phil’s mercurial spirits had risen to the
highest pitch of enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>‘I say, Tor, we must have a lark out of this
to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘All right. How?’</p>

<p>‘I’m like Maud, am I not?’</p>

<p>‘As like as two peas, and the image of your
father, too.’</p>

<p>‘Then introduce me at breakfast as your
friend Mr. Torwood, and be Philip Debenham
yourself, and see what they all say!’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ answered Tor, with a grin; ‘I
will.’</p>

<small>PHIL OR TOR?</small></h2>
</div>


<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/i_t.jpg" alt="T" /></div>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">he</span> following morning dawned bright
and clear. Tor woke early, despite
his late hours the previous evening,
and woke with a joyous consciousness of being
once more his own self—Torrington Torwood;
no longer obliged to play a part, no longer
obliged to watch his words and guard his conduct,
and, above all, no longer forced to act
towards Maud as if he were merely an affectionate
brother.</p>

<p>With intense satisfaction Tor awoke to the
fact that his task was done; and as he lay and
considered the events of the past months, he
thought to himself that, on the whole, it had
been well done.</p>

<p>Things at Ladywell were on a very different
footing now, from what they had been three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
months back. Then Mr. Belassis had had
considerable influence in all affairs which concerned
his nephew’s property; he knew
exactly what was done upon the estate, and
how it was done. He had, during a brief
period, managed all the buying and selling,
and regulated the expenditure of the household
and farms. Maud was all but engaged
to marry his son, and did not attempt to deny
that, had no strong hand held her back, she
would most likely have pledged herself to
do so.</p>

<p>Now, all idea of this marriage had been
abandoned, and Mr. Belassis had gradually
sunk into a very different position from the
one he had formerly occupied in reference to
the Ladywell property.</p>

<p>Firmly and quietly Tor had shelved his
supposed uncle, and had gradually deprived
him of every opportunity of tampering with
his affairs.</p>

<p>He had not quarrelled with him, had not
openly told him that he thought him a knave
and a fool both; but he had conveyed to him
in a hundred different forms the suggestion that
he had much better mind his own business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>He had soon found that when he and the
bailiff had the buying and selling to manage,
the profits were much larger and the expenses
less heavy. Belassis had been making a
pretty profit out of the transactions he had
carried on for three months, and was evidently
hoping that his nephew would leave a good
deal of responsibility in his hands still.</p>

<p>Phil might have done so, as Tor was fully
aware. Phil was good-tempered, easy-going,
and perfectly innocent of all malice or resentment.
Anybody could get round Phil,
who was a true Debenham in his dislike
for ‘a row’ and his distaste for trouble; and
any couple so unscrupulous as Mr. and Mrs.
Belassis would soon have had him quite in
their power.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think they can catch him now,
though,’ said Tor to himself. ‘I’ve put them
in their place, and they’ll be obliged to stay
there. Phil isn’t a fool, though he’s something
of a muff in his laziness and good-nature; but
I am pretty sure, after what I have to tell
him, that he’ll never have much to say to his
precious relatives. And I think the Belassis’
have too much sense to try to get round him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
as long as I am on the spot, and that may be
some time, unless Maud will have nothing to
do with me;’ and here Tor smiled to himself,
as though he did not anticipate any very
severe rebuff at Maud’s hands.</p>

<p>When he was dressed he sought out Phil,
who looked more than ever like himself, after
another shave and a more vigorous attempt to
remove his bronze.</p>

<p>Tor laughed aloud when he saw him.</p>

<p>‘To think that yesterday you were that
confounded Italian! Oh, Phil! I’ll never
forgive you for playing me such a shabby
trick!’</p>

<p>‘Now just hold your tongue, Phil Debenham,’
laughed Phil. ‘Don’t you know I’m
Mr. Torwood this morning, just returned from
my travels—arrived late last night? There,
let me brush my hair over my forehead.
Don’t I look just like Maud? Why don’t you
make love to me, Tor, old man?’</p>

<p>‘Make love to an ass!’ retorted Tor. ‘Just
part your hair decently, and come along. I’ve
heard Maud and Miss Marjory go down. Don’t
snigger when you’re introduced, or I won’t go
through with it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>‘All right,’ answered Phil, beginning, nevertheless,
to ‘snigger’ promptly. ‘I’ll be propriety
itself. I don’t promise not to grin when
I see you kiss Maud, though!’</p>

<p>‘If you do——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, then I won’t. Anything for a
quiet life. Do come on. I want to see them
all, and how they’ll take it. Will Miss Marjory
know?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but she won’t spoil anyone’s game.
Come on.’</p>

<p>Two minutes later, Tor brought his guest
into the breakfast-room. All the ladies were
assembled there, some seated, some standing
about, looking at their letters, and exchanging
amiable remarks.</p>

<p>Maud sprang forward to greet Tor.</p>

<p>‘Phil, you bad boy, you’re late!’ she said;
and then she saw that he was followed by a
stranger.</p>

<p>‘My friend, Mr. Torwood, Maud!’ said Tor,
presenting Phil, who behaved very well, all
things considered. ‘He turned up late last
night, and gave me no end of a surprise.
You would give him a very warm welcome, if
you half knew how glad I am to see him here.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Maud turned to the stranger with her
brightest smile, gave him her hand, and
glanced into his face. Then the words of
welcome seemed suddenly to die away. She
looked at him, and then she looked at Tor,
and back again at the new-comer, and she
held her peace.</p>

<p>‘Very glad to make your acquaintance,
Miss Debenham,’ said Phil, in a voice as
exactly like her own as a man’s can be like a
woman’s. ‘My friend’s relations almost seem
to be mine.’</p>

<p>A warning look from Tor checked any
further claim to relationship, otherwise he
might have gone on from bad to worse.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine had turned somewhat pale,
and had sat gazing at Phil ever since he had
entered, very much as one might gaze at one
returned from the dead. She had not moved
or spoken, nor did she seem capable of doing
either.</p>

<p>Ethel was staring hard at Maud and the
stranger, her round eyes full of astonishment.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory alone was equal to the occasion—as
when was she not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>‘Mr. Torwood!’ she exclaimed, rising and
advancing with her most gracious smile, ‘this
is an unexpected pleasure. Mr. Torwood,
senior, was one of my best and most intimate
friends, and I am delighted to make the acquaintance
of the son, whom I have not seen
since he was a baby in long-clothes.’</p>

<p>‘He has grown a little since then, has he
not?’ said Phil, with his merry, mischievous
smile (which made him more like Maud than
ever), as he shook hands with Miss Marjory.</p>

<p>The ice thus broken, the remaining ladies
were presented, and the party sat down to
breakfast—Tor and Miss Marjory, as usual,
making talk, to cover the unwonted silence of
the others.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the puzzled look
on the faces round the table. Phil, of course,
was all ‘on the grin and the giggle,’ as Maud
afterwards described it, and was so bubbling
over with secret amusement that it was all
Tor could do to preserve a decent gravity, and
address him in a natural way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine could do nothing but look
at the stranger, and from him to Maud and
back again; and her face wore an expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
of bewildered perplexity that was almost
pathetic.</p>

<p>Ethel’s eyes were abnormally round; and
Maud sat as if tongue-tied. She did not even
wish to think; but she could not rid herself
of the presentiment that some startling revelation
was imminent.</p>

<p>‘Where is Signor Pagliadini?’ she asked
presently, remembering for the first time their
guest of the previous evening.</p>

<p>Phil sniggered audibly.</p>

<p>‘He seems to have taken to himself the
wings of the morning,’ answered Tor readily.
‘His room was empty as I came down. He’s
an odd chap. Perhaps he’s off to Meredith’s
again. He’s always doing something ridiculous.’
Here he looked severely at Phil.</p>

<p>‘I never thought Signor Pagliadini at all
ridiculous,’ observed Maud, by way of keeping
up the conversation. ‘He always seemed dignified
and self-possessed.’</p>

<p>‘So does a jackass at times,’ returned Tor.
Whereat Phil choked in a way which drew the
eyes of the whole table upon him.</p>

<p>Tor felt that this state of things could not
further be prolonged; but his instinct of mischief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
had been aroused, and he was determined
to get what amusement he could out of the
situation.</p>

<p>‘What makes you stare so at Mr. Torwood,
Maud?’ he asked suddenly. ‘You hardly
ever seem to me to take your eyes off his
face.’</p>

<p>Maud coloured vividly, and looked daggers
at her wicked brother.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle doubtless admires me greatly,’
said Phil, with his Signor Pagliadini bow and
smile. ‘Mademoiselle flatters me more than
I can say.’</p>

<p>Although he spoke English, there was something
in tone and look so unmistakably identical
with those of the supposed Italian, that an
expression of utter mystification passed over
all faces, save those of the two conspirators.
Even Miss Marjory looked puzzled for a moment;
but she quickly mastered the true
bearing of past events, and laughed to herself
heartily and silently.</p>

<p>Tor continued in his gravest way:</p>

<p>‘Aunt Olive, you seem equally fascinated
by my friend. His charms of person seem so
to entrance you that you cannot even eat your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
breakfast. Tor, old man, I shan’t be able to
take you into society again, if you are going to
cut me out like this.’</p>

<p>Phil’s face quivered. He tried to answer,
but failed signally, and, after several struggles
to restrain himself, gave way and laughed irrepressively.</p>

<p>Maud sprang from her chair with flushed
cheeks and dilated eyes. She made a sort of
rush towards the man she had believed to be
her brother, and then stopped suddenly short.</p>

<p>‘Phil,’ she said, in a trembling voice, ‘what
does it all mean?’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘You know—you know quite well. Who is
that man? and who are you?’</p>

<p>‘“That man,” as you forcibly describe him,
is your brother, and my esteemed friend, Philip
Debenham; and I, who by force of circumstances
have heretofore been his <i>locum tenens</i>
and representative, am now able to lay aside
my borrowed plumes, and make myself known
to you under my true name—Torrington Torwood.’</p>

<p>Phil had risen too, and was standing beside
his sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>‘Maud,’ he said softly, ‘my own dear little
sister, have you no word for me? You used
to be fond of me, when we were little children
playing together by the wishing-well. Our
wish has come true—Ladywell is mine, but I
shall not value it half so much as I do my
sister’s love.’</p>

<p>She knew him then, knew without a doubt
that this man was her own brother; and with
a sense of mingled sorrow, joy, and relief, she
turned to him, and put her arms about his
neck.</p>

<p>‘Phil, dear Phil! It is you after all, then!
Oh, Phil! what does it all mean?’</p>

<p>‘It means that I have had the noblest,
most generous friend that ever man did have.
Maud, my little sister, you must love him for
my sake and his own. We both owe very
much to him.’</p>

<p>Phil had whispered these words as they
stood close together, and the tumult of wondering
voices drowned his low tones, which were
only heard by Maud.</p>

<p>She knew well enough that what he said
was true, and that to Tor’s courage and independence
of action they did owe very much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>He was not her brother at all; but she
could not lose the sense of intimacy which the
past three months had established between
them. It was impossible all in a moment to
realize that, in a manner, they were now
strangers to one another.</p>

<p>She turned from Phil, who was at once
folded in Aunt Olive’s loving embrace, and
faced Tor with one of her most bewitching
looks—smiles, blushes, shyness and confidence
all struggling together for mastery.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what to say to you, sir, who
have deceived us all these months; but I can’t
help being very glad you did, for I’m sure
things would never have been so comfortably
arranged if it had been Phil, not you, who had
had the first settling to manage. I am ever
so much obliged to you—Mr. Torwood.’</p>

<p>And she held out her hand, which he took,
and kept possession of, whilst he looked long
and smilingly into her downcast face.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Miss Debenham,’ he said, releasing
her; ‘I am glad you have not cast me
off altogether, in indignation at my deception.
I have no intention of being cast off, I can
tell you; and I shall lay claim to my privilege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
of a walk round the garden with you after
breakfast, as usual.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said Maud.</p>

<p>Her face suddenly crimsoned, and she
hastily retired to her own seat behind the
sheltering urn.</p>

<p>Her feelings were in such a tumult, that it
was no wonder she desired to elude observation
and give herself time to recover.</p>

<p>‘But who and what was Signor Pagliadini?’
cried Miss Marjory, when a little of the
hubbub had subsided, and all had returned
to their seats.</p>

<p>‘Signora,’ said Phil, in his polished Italian,
‘you see now before you that misguided man,
whom you so mercilessly frightened by trying
to strip him of his disguise, before the time had
come.’</p>

<p>‘You Signor Pagliadini!’ exclaimed Miss
Marjory. ‘Why, I shouldn’t have thought
you’d have the brains to play the part so
well!’</p>

<p>‘Exactly what my friend Tor told me. It’s
a great thing to have a faithful friend, isn’t
it? I see he has been faithful in his delineation
of my character to you. It is gratifying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
my vanity to have successfully deceived two
such clever people.’</p>

<p>‘You’d not have deceived me if I’d ever
seen you as you are,’ answered Miss Marjory
stoutly.</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t believe I should,’ Phil assented
readily. ‘Miss Marjory, you nearly frightened
me into a fit at Maud’s majority dinner.’</p>

<p>‘I wish I’d frightened you more,’ returned
she viciously. ‘You’ve not got half what
you deserve, practising on the credulity of
honest people, and making us all so uncomfortable.
What did you do it for?’</p>

<p>‘Because I was an ass—a dignified jackass,
as Tor has so aptly described me. I can’t resent
the description, because it’s true to the
life. I’ll tell you all about it soon; but let
me enjoy myself now.’</p>

<p>‘The dear boy!’ murmured Mrs. Lorraine
tenderly. ‘The dear, dear boy! So like his
father! Poor dear Philip—if only he could
have lived to see this day!’</p>

<p>‘Aunt Olive, you’ve not changed a bit,’
cried Phil. ‘You’re just as pretty as ever. Do
you remember how I used to upset your workbasket
every day, and tell you not to mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
because I’d marry you when I’d grown as big
as you?’</p>

<p>‘Bless you, I remember it like yesterday,’
answered Mrs. Lorraine, with tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>‘I’m so sorry the old house has gone. I
should have liked to have seen the little octagon
room again, where you used to sit and work,
Aunt Olive. I slept in the room over it, I
know, and liked it so much because it had the
evening and morning sun, both. Do you remember
the big griffin I drew on the wall to
frighten Maud? And how frightened I was
myself because it wouldn’t rub out, and
always seemed grinning at me in the dark?
You papered the room with rosebuds yourself,
then, you dear old auntie, to save me from a
scolding from papa.’</p>

<p>There was certainly no mistaking the real
Phil when once he had come. He was full
of reminiscences of former places and old
friends. Tor had done well with what slight
knowledge he possessed of Phil’s childhood;
but the real Phil could go on by the hour with
boyish recollections of Ladywell and home.</p>

<p>Maud escaped to the garden when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
breakfast-party rose. Just at present she
could not talk freely to the newly-found
brother; she was too much startled and perplexed
by the suddenness of the change.</p>

<p>It had been a habit from the first, that she
and Tor should stroll round the garden together
before the day’s work began; and from
what he had said, she fancied that he intended
still to keep up this habit. How would he
treat her now? how would he behave? He
had always been so quiet and reserved in his
affection, she so open and familiar.</p>

<p>She felt glad now that he had acted thus,
for she saw that he had taken no undue
advantage of his position, and respected him
the more for it; but she did wish (and her
cheek crimsoned at the thought) that she had
herself been a little more reserved in the affection
she had expressed for himself.</p>

<p>‘But it wasn’t my fault,’ she said to herself,
half aloud; ‘for I thought he was my brother,
and I did love him ever so much.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t put it into the past tense, Maud,’
said a voice behind her; and she found that
her hands were held fast by Tor. ‘Is a brother
the only person in the world you can love?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>Maud’s eyes fell before his, but she did not
try to withdraw her hands.</p>

<p>‘Have you transferred <i>all</i> the love you
had for me to the real Phil?’ he asked
again.</p>

<p>‘I suppose I ought,’ answered Maud, beginning
to smile. ‘I suppose in time I shall;
but, you know, you have told me that transfers
are tedious and tiresome affairs.’</p>

<p>‘So they are, Maud,’ he answered—‘much
too tedious and tiresome to be worth the
undertaking in some cases. Look here—let me
help you out of a difficulty. Give Phil as
much love as ever you like—new love for the
new Phil, and let me keep the old love that I
have won. It was not <i>all</i> given to me, was
it, Maud, because I was thought to be a
brother?’</p>

<p>He drew her towards him, and she did not
resist, not even when her head was touching
his shoulder.</p>

<p>‘You love me, Maud?’</p>

<p>‘You know I do. I’m sure I’ve told you so
often enough. It’s no good going on in the
proper way and pretending I don’t,’ said poor
Maud, who felt that her maiden’s privilege of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
fibbing was taken away from her by force of
circumstances.</p>

<p>‘I have loved you ever since I knew you.
You don’t know how hard it has been to call
you “sister.”’</p>

<p>Maud nestled more comfortably against his
shoulder then.</p>

<p>‘You dear boy! Are you sure?’</p>

<p>‘Quite sure. I’ve had a few youthful
spoons, Maud. I won’t lie to you, even in a
moment like this. But I’ve never really loved
a woman till I loved you; and I feel as if I
could love as well as most men. You shall be
the one to prove if it is not so.’</p>

<p>‘You dear boy!’ said Maud again.</p>

<p>‘Sometimes you’ve complained that I haven’t
kissed you often enough, Maud. If you don’t
mind, I’ll make up for the deficiency now.’</p>

<p>Maud did not seem to mind at all. She
turned up a happy face, which was certainly
well kissed.</p>

<p>‘I’m glad you’re not my brother, Tor,’ said
Maud, when the kissing was over.</p>

<p>‘So am I,’ he answered gravely. ‘This is
much more satisfactory, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Very much more,’ she answered; and by-and-by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
she added, ‘and Tor’s a much nicer
name than Phil. Phil doesn’t suit you: it
sounds too small. I wonder I never thought
of it before.’</p>

<p>‘If we stay here much longer, we shall have
other people upon us,’ remarked Tor.</p>

<p>‘Let us go, then, and hide,’ cried Maud
eagerly. ‘We’ve got such lots to say.’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t you lots to say to Phil?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Phil can wait!’</p>

<p>Not displeased at this sentiment, Tor led
Maud away to a secluded part of the park,
where they passed a couple of hours in a
fashion infinitely satisfactory to themselves,
but not interesting to the historian.</p>

<p>They were soon missed by those that remained;
but Phil and Miss Marjory only
smiled, and said they had better not be sought
for.</p>

<p>Phil told his story to her, and received a
good deal of the verbal castigation for which
Miss Marjory was famous.</p>

<p>‘Not trust Mr. Torwood! You who had
known him eighteen years! I never heard
anything so disgraceful in my life! You ought
to be ashamed of yourself! I knew he was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
be trusted before I had known him eighteen
hours.’</p>

<p>‘We cannot all be so clever as you, Miss
Marjory.’</p>

<p>‘Now——’ she began warningly; and Phil
was silenced, though not for long.</p>

<p>‘Don’t hate me, Miss Marjory, please.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think you’re worth hating.’</p>

<p>‘No, I’m not—I assure you I’m not. You’ve
just hit the mark. I’m not worth your lofty
scorn and contempt, so please reserve it for a
more deserving object.’</p>

<p>And then Miss Marjory laughed, and she
and Phil made friends.</p>

<p>‘Ah, my dear,’ she said, an hour or two
later, as she met Maud dancing and singing
along the corridor, ‘didn’t I give you good
advice, when I told you that you had better
wait for Mr. Torwood?’</p>

<p>‘You did indeed, Miss Marjory.’</p>

<p>‘Was I very wrong in asserting that he
might possibly resemble the adored “Phil”?’</p>

<p>Maud kissed her suddenly on both cheeks.</p>

<p>‘You were right, as you always are—a real
fairy godmother; and I was a very good child,
and did exactly as you advised!’</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap"> think</span> I must take you over to
Thornton House this afternoon,
Phil,’ said Tor, ‘and reintroduce
you to your esteemed aunt and uncle.’</p>

<p>Phil made a grimace, which indicated that
he did not look forward with eagerness to the
impending introduction to his kinsfolk.</p>

<p>‘I wanted to go and see old Meredith.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll take him on the way back, if you
like,’ answered Tor; ‘but you ought to go
first to see the Belassis family.’</p>

<p>They were sitting at lunch when this conversation
took place, and Phil, for the first
time, had taken his place at the foot of the
table. Tor sat beside Maud, and seemed to
feel in nowise degraded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>The servants knew nothing of the transformation
which had taken place. They
believed that the young squire had arrived
late the previous evening, and that the Signor
had been called away the following morning.
They were too much excited by the sudden
change of master to have much interest to
spare for the Italian.</p>

<p>All their thoughts were given to puzzling
over the strange change which had taken
place; and all tongues were uttering speculations
as to why Mr. Debenham had sent Mr.
Torwood in his place, and made him take his
name for three whole months.</p>

<p>Phil was glad enough that it should be so.
He was heartily ashamed of his distrust of his
friend, and consequently the whole of the
Signor Pagliadini episode was highly distasteful
to him. He felt degraded by the thought
that he had come in disguise to spy upon Tor;
and he was really anxious that the matter
should remain unknown, outside the walls of
his own house.</p>

<p>Hence his reluctance to face Mrs. Belassis.</p>

<p>‘I was almost conspiring with her against
Tor,’ he said ruefully. ‘I could not bear her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
ever to remind me of that, and I know she
will.’</p>

<p>‘Why should she ever have the opportunity?’
said Miss Marjory. ‘It will be your fault if
she does.’</p>

<p>‘How?’</p>

<p>‘It was Signor Pagliadini, not Mr. Philip
Debenham, who nearly made a confidante of
her.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory spoke with some significance,
and Phil’s face brightened.</p>

<p>‘You think I needn’t say that I was the
Signor?’</p>

<p>‘Why should you say so?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know, I’m sure. I fancied it would
all have to come out.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. Don’t you think she’ll
suspect?’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t—I’m quite sure she won’t,’
said Miss Marjory, nodding her head emphatically.
‘If you deceived me, young man,
I’m quite sure you equally deceived Mrs.
Belassis.’</p>

<p>‘I think,’ said Mrs. Lorraine gently, ‘that
no one besides our six selves need ever know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
exactly how matters really stand, or that Mr.
Torwood ever acted as anything but dear
Philip’s deputy.’</p>

<p>‘Quite so,’ said Miss Marjory. ‘Mr. Torwood
was doing the best thing possible for
his friend’s interests; and if not very wisely,
he acted most generously, and great good has
been done by it.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, yes,’ cried Phil eagerly; ‘and do
you really think nobody else need know what
an ass I’ve been?’</p>

<p>‘If you don’t betray yourself,’ said Miss
Marjory, ‘nobody else will betray you.’</p>

<p>Phil drew a long breath of satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘Oh, jolly!’ he cried in his boyish way;
‘and won’t my uncle and aunt be sold!
They’ll think I knew all the time that Tor
was here, and that I was in the plot. I hope
they will feel properly “done.”’</p>

<p>‘You must be bold and firm with them,’
said Miss Marjory; ‘you must stand up for
every measure your friend has taken. You
must say that everything he did has your
complete sanction.’</p>

<p>‘Of course I shall.’</p>

<p>‘And they can easily be made to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
that you were aware the whole time of your
friend’s movements.’</p>

<p>‘And they shall think so too!’ cried Phil
eagerly; ‘and if they try to cast in my teeth
what that old Pagliadini said, I will lay it
hot on him!’</p>

<p>‘I think you will enjoy abusing the Signor,’
remarked Maud, smiling.</p>

<p>‘That I shall,’ cried Phil. ‘I abuse him
to myself every time I think of him.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Tor, bringing matters round to
the point from which they had strayed, ‘is it
agreed that we call together at Thornton
House to-day?’</p>

<p>‘It is,’ said Phil.</p>

<p>At Thornton House that day a somewhat
animated interview was taking place between
Mrs. Belassis and her husband.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be remembered that it
was only upon the previous afternoon Mrs.
Belassis had made an attack upon Tor at
Ladywell, and had heard from Miss Marjory
the disgraceful story of her husband’s first
marriage, and his subsequent desertion of his
young wife.</p>

<p>She had appeared to take the news quietly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
for she had not been able, in her excitement
and indignation against Tor, to consider with
calmness her own possible position; and she
had, at the moment, felt convinced that the
first wife must have died, and that he must
have known of her death before he had dared
to marry again; but when she began to review
the subject dispassionately, a great fear fell
upon her that this might not be so, and a
hundred little forgotten incidents rose up
before her, all tending to increase her doubts.
Her husband’s eagerness to engage himself to
her, and his constant postponement of the
wedding, looked significant enough to her now.
His ill-assured manner all through the marriage
day and later, and his wish not to
advertise the ceremony, came back to her
memory now and made her tremble. Then
his fear and anxiety when Whitbury was
named were certainly strange, as was also his
craven and cowed air when he had met Miss
Marjory.</p>

<p>It was possible, of course, that he might be
cowed and timid, in any case, at meeting one
who could reveal the fact of the first marriage;
but all seemed to point to the conclusion that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
had never really ascertained the fate of the
woman he had wedded only to desert.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis could not speak to her husband
on her return, for he had started upon a
business expedition from which he was not
expected home until the following day.</p>

<p>Time, however, gave Mrs. Belassis opportunity
to nurse her wrath and plan out a course
of action, and certainly the expression of her
countenance, as she sat at the luncheon-table
opposite the husband, who had just returned,
boded him no good; and after one or two
feeble attempts at conversation, he sank into
silence, quaking inwardly and wondering what
was to come.</p>

<p>‘I wish to speak to you, Mr. Belassis,’ she
said, as they rose from table.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, my love.’</p>

<p>Lewis and the girls looked on aghast.
The latter had felt that a storm was brewing,
and had not dared to tell their father and
brother, as they were longing to do, that
‘Phil’ was engaged to Roma, and that he was
not really ‘Phil’ at all, but an impostor.</p>

<p>They had felt bound to keep silence at
luncheon; but when their father and mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
had retired to the study, they pounced upon
Lewis and poured into his ears the bewildering
tale which they had lately heard themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Belassis followed his wife slowly and
reluctantly into his study, feeling that an evil
time lay before him.</p>

<p>‘Sit down, Mr. Belassis,’ she said.</p>

<p>He sat down meekly.</p>

<p>‘Well, my love, what is it?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t call me “my love” again, until I
give you leave. What has become, Mr. Belassis,
of your first wife? Tell me that.’</p>

<p>‘My—f-first—wife!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, your first wife—you are not going to
look me in the face and say you have not had
one!’</p>

<p>He did not look her in the face, and he did
not utter a word.</p>

<p>‘Where is the first Mrs. Belassis—tell me
that!’</p>

<p>‘Dead.’</p>

<p>‘Are you sure?’</p>

<p>‘Y-yes—I’m as sure as I can be.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis shivered slightly. It was, then,
as she had suspected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>‘When did she die?’</p>

<p>There was a pause; which he broke by answering
with assumed assurance:</p>

<p>‘Ages ago; long before I married you.’</p>

<p>‘That’s a lie!’</p>

<p>He shrank before her tone and look.</p>

<p>‘How—how do you know?’</p>

<p>‘I know that she was alive three months
before you married me.’</p>

<p>His face turned livid.</p>

<p>‘How do you know?’</p>

<p>‘I was told, on good authority.’</p>

<p>‘By whom?’</p>

<p>‘By Miss Marjory Descartes.’</p>

<p>‘Good heavens!’ cried the miserable man,
starting up. ‘If you’ve been talking to her,
it’s all over with me. She has no mercy.’</p>

<p>Then there was a long pause, which at first
neither seemed inclined to break.</p>

<p>‘You mean to tell me, then,’ said Mrs.
Belassis, at last, ‘that I am not your wife at
all?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ he cried desperately. ‘I
can’t tell you anything—I don’t know myself.
I never could find out what became of
her. I did make inquiries—I did all I could.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
I found out that she had left Whitbury, that
she was in a consumption, and was gone away
south, and was not likely to live through the
winter. I couldn’t get to know where she
was, and you wouldn’t wait longer. I made
sure she had died in the winter, and I believe
still that she did; but I don’t know, and I
can’t say more.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked coldly and scornfully at
him.</p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t wait! Hadn’t I waited five
years for your whims? Was it likely I cared
for you enough to waste my whole life waiting?
Why didn’t you tell me you were a married
man?’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t know whether I was or not,’ he
answered sullenly.</p>

<p>‘Then why didn’t you say that you didn’t
know?’</p>

<p>He glared at her like a wild beast at
bay.</p>

<p>‘Take care, Mrs. Belassis—take care! Don’t
drive me too far.’</p>

<p>‘I am not aware that I am Mrs. Belassis.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not aware that you’re not, anyhow.
I believe you are; and when I’ve proved this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
miserable creature’s death, I’ll make you feel
that I am your lord and master.’</p>

<p>Some of the old brutal power of the man
was returning to him in this extremity.
There had been a time when Mrs. Belassis
had half-feared and admired, whilst she half-despised
him. It seemed as though danger
of disgrace had roused in him some of his old
force of character.</p>

<p>‘You’d better not threaten me, Mr. Belassis.
So long as the doubt remains a doubt, I will
stay where I am, and act as your wife; but
remember, that whether or not our marriage
is legal, you have behaved abominably; and
if I expose you, you will not find it
pleasant.’</p>

<p>‘It will hurt you more than it hurts me—exposure
will!’ began Belassis savagely; then,
catching the look in her eye, he paused and
said: ‘Come, Celia, be reasonable. What is
the good of our quarrelling? Nobody need
know this miserable story, unless you betray
it; and they’ll find it hard to prove that <i>she</i>
was alive, as nobody seems to know where
she went to, when she left Yorkshire. I don’t
see that anybody can have any interest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
raking up an old story like that; and I shall
be always ready to swear to her death. I’ll
get a certificate if necessary. I can easily
manage that.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis sat silent.</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> must know the truth. I cannot go on
like this,’ she said slowly. ‘But so long as
matters remain uncertain, I suppose things
must go on as they are. We have one enemy,
however, who knows of the existence of the
first Mrs. Belassis, and of the doubt of her
death. He will ruin us if he can!’</p>

<p>‘Who is he?’</p>

<p>‘The man now calling himself Philip Debenham
and our nephew.’</p>

<p>‘Calling himself?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; that man is really Torrington Torwood!’</p>

<p>‘Celia!’</p>

<p>‘He is. I have suspected him for long. I
knew all was not well, though I could not lay
my finger on the fraud. I know, now, what
it is—the man is an impostor—only that!—an
impostor and a forger!’</p>

<p>‘How do you know?’</p>

<p>‘Signor Pagliadini told me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>‘That Italian? Does he know Philip and
his friend?’</p>

<p>‘He has known them both well. It is Mr.
Torwood who is reigning here. Poor Philip
is in a kind of captivity, awaiting his tyrant’s
orders. At present he is at sea—safely out
of the way.’</p>

<p>‘We must rescue him!’ cried Belassis, a
vision of golden possibilities rising at once
before his eyes. ‘We, his next of kin, will
rescue him from the clutch of this villain,
and reinstate him in his own inheritance!
Celia, my love! the tables will be turned, and
our fortunes will be made! We will drive
out this impostor with scorn and obloquy!
I will prosecute him myself, and he shall be
transported for life! Penal servitude is just
fit for him, and such as he! When dear
Philip has his own again—ah, how different
it will all be! I knew that man was not a
Debenham, and Philip must be his father’s
own son, or this Torwood could not ride
rough-shod over him as he does. Ah, my
dear! when we get our own nephew safe
under our protection at Ladywell, how different
everything will look!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>This had been Mrs. Belassis’ own conclusion,
but she saw more difficulties in the
way.</p>

<p>‘We must prove our case first. Torwood
will not give way readily. I charged him with
the fraud yesterday, openly, but he had the
impudence to look me in the face and tell me
that he should prefer to hear of such matters
through my legal adviser! Oh, you needn’t
be afraid! He’s Torwood, as sure as you’re
Belassis; but he has got the property, and he
will fight for it.’</p>

<p>Belassis considered awhile, and his eye
began to glitter.</p>

<p>‘So much the better, perhaps. Phil’s
gratitude will be all the greater, after a hard
fight.’</p>

<p>‘We must find Phil first.’</p>

<p>‘True. Does anyone but this impostor
know where he is?’</p>

<p>‘I fancy Signor Pagliadini does.’</p>

<p>‘Who is this Signor Pagliadini?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. Evidently some friend of
Phil’s, who has come over to look after his
interests.’</p>

<p>‘Has Phil sent him?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t know. He cannot speak English,
and he is very reserved about himself.’</p>

<p>‘But he is Torwood’s enemy?’</p>

<p>‘I should say so.’</p>

<p>‘And therefore our friend.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be too sure of that. He was anything
but open with me. I wormed a good deal
out of him; but I’m not sure that he intended
me to.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll make him speak out!’ cried Belassis
heartily and eagerly. ‘I’ve not been a lawyer
for nothing; and I flatter myself I know how
to get at information when I want it, and how
to get up a case when I’ve an object to gain.
The first thing to do, when we’ve won over this
Signor, is to find our poor wronged nephew;
and the next, to prosecute this Torrington
Torwood for forgery and fraud.’</p>

<p>A knock at the door had passed unheeded,
so it was simply thrown open, whilst the
servant briefly announced:</p>

<p>‘Mr. Debenham and Mr. Torwood.’</p>

<p>Dead silence reigned in the room, as the two
young men made their entrance.</p>

<p>‘Good-afternoon,’ said Tor pleasantly. ‘I
hope we do not interrupt anything very important.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
I felt I must not lose time in introducing
to you your real nephew, Philip
Debenham, or in explaining to Mrs. Belassis
that her shrewd surmise as to my identity is
perfectly correct. Yesterday the time had not
come to declare it; but now it has, and I have
great pleasure in withdrawing from the position
I have hitherto held as your nephew, and
in presenting the rightful claimant for your
affections, Philip Debenham.’</p>

<p>If a bomb had exploded in their midst, it
could not have produced a more profound
sensation of dismay and consternation.</p>

<p>‘You seem surprised, uncle,’ said Phil,
advancing with a smile. ‘I should have
thought you would have been prepared by
my aunt.’</p>

<p>‘My dear, <i>dear</i> boy!’ stammered Belassis,
with all the fervour his confused mind could
muster. ‘My own dear Philip! welcome,
welcome home to your true friends, who really
care for you and your interests!’</p>

<p>‘Well, uncle, I’m glad enough to get home,’
said Phil. ‘It’s not been my fault I’ve stayed
away so long; and for the rest, this friend
here has looked so well after me and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
interests for the past ten years, and especially
for the past three months, that I can’t
say I feel any special yearnings after new
ones.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis was gazing coldly and fixedly
at Tor, who seemed quite at his ease even
under the awful glare of her eyes.</p>

<p>‘Young man,’ she said threateningly, ‘do
you imagine for a moment that you will be
allowed to escape all the consequences of this
gross imposition and fraud, which you have
been practising upon us?’</p>

<p>‘I’ll take my chance of that,’ answered Tor
serenely. ‘I don’t feel under any pressing
anxiety, so far.’</p>

<p>‘We shall prosecute,’ said Mrs. Belassis
grandly.</p>

<p>‘I shall be delighted if you do,’ answered
Tor. ‘I’m afraid you will find some difficulty
in procuring counsel.’</p>

<p>‘Difficulty!’</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s generally rather difficult to get
counsel when you’ve got no case,’ explained
Tor affably.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis was silent, through extreme
indignation. Her husband, who better understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
the law, appealed with more zeal than
discretion to his nephew.</p>

<p>‘You must prosecute. Philip! You must
not let this act pass unnoticed and unpunished.
He has signed your cheques and papers, and
perpetrated every kind of fraud. You must
not allow such a monstrous imposition to go
unpunished—for the sake of justice you must
not.’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, I think justice can take care of
herself without any protection from me; and
as for prosecuting Tor, for doing me the
greatest service in his power, I never heard of
anything so monstrously ridiculous in all my
life.’</p>

<p>‘The greatest service!’ echoed Mrs. Belassis.
‘A service to rob you of your name, get your
affairs into a shocking state, and quarrel with
all your friends. Fine service, indeed!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, a great service. I was ill—I could
not attend to things myself; but he has
brought everything round to a most satisfactory
issue. My agent did much better than
I could have done.’</p>

<p>‘Your agent! He did not come as your
agent, but as yourself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>‘Exactly—the only satisfactory way in
which he could come. Why he did so, is his
business and mine. You had better not
inquire more closely into the matter.’</p>

<p>‘Your agent! Signor Pagliadini said——’</p>

<p>‘Signor Pagliadini is an old fool.’</p>

<p>‘You know him, then?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, for a meddling, blunder-headed fool.
You will see no more of the Signor, Aunt
Belassis.’</p>

<p>‘Has he gone, then?’</p>

<p>‘Gone to the place he came from, to hide his
diminished head. He vanished double-quick,
I can tell you, when I appeared upon the
scene.’</p>

<p>This was the final blow. All lingering
hope of proving Tor a villain, was crushed by
the news of Signor Pagliadini’s sudden flight.</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t think I’ll stay longer to-day,’
said Phil. ‘You seem altogether too much
astonished to have anything to say. I’ll look
in another day when you have got over your
surprise. Tor would have me come to report
myself at headquarters, and I’ve done it now.
You may congratulate yourself, uncle, that
you had Tor to deal with in the first place, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
me. I’m an awful duffer at business, and
never do understand things. Any fool could
cheat me. But Tor, he’s made of different
stuff, and he can’t have tried your patience
half so much as I should have done. You’ll
be saved all trouble now with my stupidity,
for he will teach me everything. He’s so well
up in all my affairs, that I feel as if he ought
to be the master.’</p>

<p>So Phil and Tor departed, leaving the husband
and wife alone together.</p>

<p>They looked in silence into each other’s
faces, as if they both felt that a great calamity
had befallen them.</p>

<p>‘Can we not prosecute, then?’ said she.</p>

<p>‘Impossible, so long as Philip supports
him.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a disgraceful scandal!’ said the wife.</p>

<p>‘It is,’ assented the husband. ‘Oh, what a
monstrous shame it has all been! If only we
had had that other man to deal with, all would
have been safe, and Maud would have been
Lewis’s wife by this time. He is the very
image of his father. I could have turned him
round my little finger.’</p>

<p>‘It seems to me that we are pretty nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
ruined every way,’ said Mrs. Belassis; ‘and
we shall be most certainly, if that will in the
Ladywell library is ever found. Five thousand
you can pay, and the interest we claim as recompense
for Maud’s expenses whilst under
our care. But fifteen thousand with interest
for eighteen years——’</p>

<p>‘Would mean simple ruin. The trust-money
is all gone.’</p>

<p>‘I know it, and we must find the will,’ said
Mrs. Belassis; ‘though I don’t know if there
is any reason why I should trouble myself
over your affairs now.’</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">hink</span> I gave him one that time,’
said Phil, as they walked away.
‘How I hated him, when I saw
him again!—just as I did when I was a
small boy and he bullied me.’</p>

<p>‘They are mad that they can’t prosecute
me,’ said Tor, laughing. ‘I should get scant
mercy at their hands.’</p>

<p>‘He looks a regular old scoundrel, and I
believe he is one; but I don’t believe I should
dare to defy him, if I hadn’t you at my back.’</p>

<p>‘The old story—eh, Phil?’</p>

<p>‘It will be the old story till the end of the
chapter, I expect, old man. You mustn’t
desert me when you marry Maud.’</p>

<p>‘No fear.’</p>

<p>‘I shall do as old Maynard wished, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
make good the money to her; he would have
left it to her, if he hadn’t been afraid of doing
more harm than good.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s not for me to stand in the way
of what you think right; but I have plenty
for both, you know, and Ladywell wants
keeping up.’</p>

<p>‘Maud shall be well dowered, anyway—that’s
my positive duty as head of the family;
but is there no way of punishing that Belassis
for ruining my father, and destroying his last
will?—for I know he did both.’</p>

<p>‘We can’t prove even the existence of that
other will, much less its destruction, though
we are quite convinced of both. As to the
other question, I have made out that it
would be a difficult matter to open an inquiry
at this distance of time. Besides, you know,
a knave can ruin an honest man without going
beyond the limit of the law, if he only knows
how to set about it. I believe Belassis did
know that well.’</p>

<p>‘The old scoundrel!’ muttered Phil. ‘I
wish we could ruin him.’</p>

<p>‘Strikes me he’ll ruin himself some of these
days, without any assistance from us.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>‘How so?’</p>

<p>‘Speculation.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! you think that?’</p>

<p>‘I do; and it strikes me it will be all he
can do to produce the £5000 of Maud’s trust-money,
which will have to be handed over.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean to say you think he’s
played fast and loose with that?’</p>

<p>‘I do. I am pretty sure it is so, otherwise
he would have cared little about the marriage.
It is either that, or else the fear that the later
will may turn up—if he has not found and
destroyed it.’</p>

<p>‘The old scoundrel! Come, Tor, we’ll
change the subject, or I shall lose my temper.
Shall we go to the Merediths’ now?’</p>

<p>‘If you like.’</p>

<p>‘I do like. I want to get things settled
with Roma. Tor, old man, you’ll settle the
father for me, won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘All right; but you must come too, or
he’ll not believe me when I try to explain.’</p>

<p>‘He won’t have a fit or anything, I hope?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no! He’ll not care a bit, so long as
Philip Debenham is willing to marry his
daughter.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>‘He’s an old ass!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t tell Roma so, anyhow; and don’t be
so free of your opinions respecting your future
father-in-law.’</p>

<p>Phil felt slightly rebuked, more by the tone
than the words.</p>

<p>‘It’s only to you, Tor. I rather like the
old boy, really.’</p>

<p>‘He’s not bad, if he can once be made to
forget himself.’</p>

<p>‘Roma is an angel! I never knew so devoted
a daughter.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think her life has been a happy
one heretofore; mind you make it more so,
Phil. She has very warm feelings, as I dare
say you know better than I, and the passionate
nature of the South, little as one would
think it. Her father’s blindness was caused
by her, in a fit of fury. She will tell you the
story herself, no doubt; she was more sinned
against than sinning, I shall always say. I
don’t think she has ever got over the shock
and the grief, and it seems to have crushed
out all the passion of her nature, and almost
all else but the devotion to her father. Remember
that, Phil; and be very gentle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
patient if she does not all at once yield to you
the first place, which naturally seems your
right.’</p>

<p>‘I will, my Mentor; I will! Give me all
the good advice you can, for I’m a muff, and
I know it; but I do love Roma!’</p>

<p>‘Then love will teach you better than I,’
said Tor; and they walked on in silence.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Philip Debenham!’ said Michael Meredith,
as the two entered the room together.
‘Philip Debenham and my friend the Signor.
I am happy to welcome you both.’</p>

<p>‘You will welcome one of us still more
warmly, when I have introduced him afresh,’
answered Tor, as he took the old man’s hand
in his.</p>

<p>‘You are pleased to speak in riddles, Philip,’
said Meredith, smiling.</p>

<p>‘Not at all, sir, I assure you.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to say that I require a
new introduction to my friend Signor Pagliadini?’</p>

<p>‘I do indeed!’</p>

<p>Meredith was smiling blandly, as if he rather
enjoyed the little mystery.</p>

<p>‘Under a new name?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes; a new name that is yet not altogether
new to you.’</p>

<p>‘Then let me hear this new, familiar name.’</p>

<p>‘The name of my friend here,’ said Tor
quietly, ‘is Philip Debenham!’</p>

<p>‘Very much at your service, sir,’ said Phil,
in his own voice and tongue; ‘who has to
return you many thanks for your hospitality,
and begs to apologize for the deception practised
upon you.’</p>

<p>Michael Meredith had started, and changed
colour somewhat, as Phil’s voice had fallen
upon his ear.</p>

<p>‘Philip Debenham! Philip Debenham!’ he
repeated slowly. ‘It is, indeed, as if one had
returned from the dead! It is the voice of
my well-beloved friend himself!’</p>

<p>‘Of his son, at least, Mr. Meredith, who
hopes soon to become well beloved on his own
account,’ said Phil.</p>

<p>‘But you, Philip—I mean, you whom I
have learned to call Philip, in spite of early
misgivings—who and what are you?’</p>

<p>‘Philip no longer, now that my work of
deputy is done. I assure you, Mr. Meredith,
I have acted in all things merely as a deputy.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>‘And who are you, then?’</p>

<p>‘He’s the best fellow in all the world!’ cried
Phil impulsively; ‘my friend Torwood!’</p>

<p>‘You are Philip Debenham—there can be
no doubt of that!’ said Meredith slowly; ‘but
why was this mystery made? Why were you
represented by your friend? Why did you
appear here in disguise? And how did you
obtain an introduction from my esteemed relative
Signor Mattei?’</p>

<p>Tor explained the matter briefly and clearly,
as much, at least, as there was any need to
explain. Mr. Meredith listened with interest
and attention. He seemed amused and entertained
by what he heard, which had about it
a flavour of romance that just suited him.
He was quite ready to become an accomplice,
and promised never to reveal the fact that
Phil and the Signor were one and the same.
He was not likely to publish anything which
should show that his perceptions had ever been
at fault.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, a cloud seemed to settle
upon his brow. Tor saw it, and understood
its meaning, and signed to Phil to
depart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>Phil obeyed gladly, being all on fire to find
and claim Roma as his own.</p>

<p>‘Now, Mr. Meredith,’ said Tor, when he
and the old man were alone together, ‘you
and I have a little matter to discuss between
us.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Mr. Torwood; and I am a man of
honour. If I must keep my word, I must;
but this has been a shock to me.’</p>

<p>‘In what way, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Can you not guess?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you are thinking of your
daughter?’</p>

<p>‘I am. I have liked you, as you know,
for your own sake. I would gladly welcome
you as a son-in-law—and yet—I have set my
heart upon marrying Roma to Philip Debenham’s
son.’</p>

<p>‘And you may do so still! Have I not
said that <i>in all things</i> I have acted merely as
my friend’s deputy?’</p>

<p>Meredith’s face expressed a sort of surprised
satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘Engaged yourself to Roma by deputy, do
you mean, Mr. Torwood?’</p>

<p>‘I think, sir,’ said Tor, smiling, ‘that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
was you who engaged us. We had little
voice in the matter, if you remember.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, I may have said the most; but I
quite understood that you accepted.’</p>

<p>‘I did not decline, because it would have
hurt you if I had done so at such a moment;
and besides, I had no right.’</p>

<p>‘How so?’</p>

<p>‘It was not to me, but to my friend Philip
that the proposition was made. I could not
decline a bride, so likely to be beloved by
him.’</p>

<p>‘You thought that?’</p>

<p>‘I did—I have every reason to think it
still.’</p>

<p>Meredith smiled gently, and then his face
grew grave.</p>

<p>‘Roma——’ he began, and said no more.</p>

<p>‘Make your mind easy; she never cared one
atom for me.’</p>

<p>‘Why—why? She always seemed——’</p>

<p>‘She merely liked me as an ordinary friend—nothing
more.’</p>

<p>‘And you?’</p>

<p>‘I cared only for Maud, who is now my
promised wife. Roma and I understood one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
another all along. I could not explain everything;
but she knew from the first that the
engagement was purely nominal.’</p>

<p>Michael Meredith held out his hand.</p>

<p>‘Sir, you are a man of honour, and a true
gentleman. I thank you with all my heart.
I could almost wish still that I might call you
son.’</p>

<p>‘Phil will be a son much more to your mind
than I could ever be, Mr. Meredith,’ answered
Tor. ‘He and Roma were made for one
another. At least, I can answer for it that
Roma is just the sort of wife he wants, to
steady him down and give him an object in
life. A little ballast is all he needs. He is
the best-hearted, sunniest-tempered fellow in
the world.’</p>

<p>‘I can believe it—as his father was before
him. I wonder——’</p>

<p>He paused; but Tor took up the word and
added:</p>

<p>‘Wonder if the second Philip Debenham
will be as amenable as the first? I should
not have much anxiety on that point.’</p>

<p>‘You think——?’</p>

<p>‘I think Roma and Signor Pagliadini spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
a great deal of time wandering about in the
moonlight together.’</p>

<p>‘Did they?’</p>

<p>Old Meredith looked disturbed for a moment,
as though he had been guilty of some
indiscretion, as indeed he had.</p>

<p>‘Really, I did not notice—I—I—. You
see, Roma was engaged.’</p>

<p>‘Only she knew she was free. She was certainly
allowed to run into danger; but on the
whole, I fancy, it will not turn out amiss.’</p>

<p>‘Go and find her,’ said Meredith. ‘I must
see her myself; go and fetch her to me.
Where has Philip Debenham gone?’</p>

<p>‘I should not be surprised to find them
together,’ said Tor, rising. ‘If so, shall I
bring both the culprits?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, do so. It is strange, indeed, how my
will always fulfils itself.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, yes,’ answered Tor, with a slight
smile.</p>

<p>‘And you know, Mr. Torwood, I did misdoubt
you somewhat from the first.’</p>

<p>‘You certainly did, sir, in the first moment
of our acquaintance. Your sagacity, you see,
was not at fault.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>And then he went off on his errand.</p>

<p>He did not find those he sought very readily;
but they were alone and together, sure enough,
in a remote part of the garden. It was not
difficult to see that Philip Debenham had
easily usurped Signor Pagliadini’s place; but
even yet Roma was not quite content.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Tor, when his presence was first
observed, ‘is it all well?’</p>

<p>‘Roma is afraid of what her father will say,’
said Phil.</p>

<p>‘He was so fond of you,’ said Roma, looking
up at him without any fear or shame.</p>

<p>‘You can’t have him now, Roma,’ said Phil.
‘He’s engaged to Maud. He lost no time, I
can assure you. He leaped from the brother
to the lover in about ten seconds. Have
you explained everything to Mr. Meredith,
Tor?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and he is desirous of bestowing his
blessing upon you. It is all right, Roma. I
told you it would be all right, if you would
only wait my time. He is more pleased than
ever. Go to him, and see for yourself if it is
not so.’</p>

<p>Phil and Roma returned slowly to the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
to receive the paternal benediction, and Tor
strolled across the park to Ladywell.</p>

<p>‘Well, Mr. Torwood,’ said a voice behind
him; ‘how does it feel to be no longer monarch
of all you survey?’</p>

<p>‘Is that you, Miss Marjory? This is well
met. I have hardly seen you all day.’</p>

<p>‘No, you found metal more attractive elsewhere.
I am not jealous, I assure you. Well,
how has the Belassis introduction passed
off?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well. Phil was quite as bold as I,
and more cheeky than I was at my first interview.
I don’t think the worthy uncle will
make much out of him.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks to you, perhaps not; but he is a
mere boy—not fit to have the management of
a place like this.’</p>

<p>‘He is only three months my junior.’</p>

<p>‘He is a mere boy, for all that, and you are
a man. I like men, for my part. When I
was young, it wasn’t the fashion to admire
long-haired, knock-kneed youths with narrow
chests and æsthetic tastes. I’m behind the
times, I know; but I stick to my old-fashioned
views. I like a man who can take a horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
across country without bringing him home
lame, and who knows more of nature than of
art. I suppose I should be called an old Philistine
nowadays.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know, I’m sure. I don’t suppose
the Philistines were half bad fellows, after
all. However, I think Phil will do very well
at Ladywell.’</p>

<p>‘You’d do better,’ said Miss Marjory.</p>

<p>‘You think so?’</p>

<p>‘I know it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Miss Marjory, I’m very glad to be
quit of it and its responsibilities, that I can
tell you,’ said Tor, stretching his long limbs
as if to assure himself that the load was gone.
‘It has been a horrid nuisance at times—all
this; and if it had not been for two things
accomplished, I should feel inclined to think I
had taken more trouble than the matter was
worth.’</p>

<p>‘What two things are those?’</p>

<p>‘Keeping Maud out of the hands of the
Belassis party, and making your acquaintance,
Miss Marjory.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory bowed.</p>

<p>‘Gaining a wife and a friend, is that it?’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
said she. ‘You might have known me long
ago if you had not been so lazy as to do all
your business through an agent. Middlemen
are a mistake.’</p>

<p>‘My middle-man shall henceforward be
dismissed. We will do business in future
always at first hand—you and I, Miss Marjory.’</p>

<p>‘And I shall get my own way in everything!’
cried Miss Marjory, with animation.
‘You don’t know what you are letting yourself
in for!’</p>

<p>‘I thought I was such a competent
manager?’</p>

<p>‘You can manage property pretty well, I
admit,’ answered Miss Marjory; ‘but I am not
aware that I ever said you could manage me!’</p>

<p>‘Perish the thought!’ cried Tor, with
fervour. ‘Miss Marjory, did anybody ever
manage you since the days of your babyhood?’</p>

<p>‘Of a certainty nobody did so during my
babyhood,’ laughed Miss Marjory. ‘I ruled
the household before I could speak.’</p>

<p>‘And I’m sure you did so afterwards,’ said
Tor, with gravity.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Miss Marjory, glancing up at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
him with quaint humour, ‘I’m not sure but
what I did.’</p>

<p>‘You were born great,’ he said, ‘whilst I
only had greatness thrust upon me, of which
I am very glad to be relieved.’</p>

<p>‘Really?’</p>

<p>‘Really and truly. Do you doubt it?’</p>

<p>‘No; but I know I shouldn’t like to give
up the reins of government when once I’d
held them. I always do want my finger in
everybody’s pie, especially when the pie takes
the form of gardens. I never go round a
place but what I want to lay it out anew
myself, and suggest improvements.’</p>

<p>‘Then I shall expect you to come and lay
out mine for me, Miss Marjory, whenever I
settle down. Now mind, I shall consider it
a bargain from this time forth.’</p>

<p>‘You are going to settle down, then? A
good thing, too. “A rolling stone,” you
know.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Miss Marjory, to tell the truth, I
don’t think you’ve gathered much moss yourself,
in spite of your devotion to Whitbury.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory laughed, but rather liked the
compliment implied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Tor, ‘I am going to settle down
as a steady married man, somewhere in this
neighbourhood, if I can get a house, so as to
be near Phil, who will of course expect me to
look after him to a certain extent. Maud
likes Devonshire, and so do I. But I shall
require one visit a year at least from you, Miss
Marjory, just to see that my garden is going
on right, and that I am not gathering moss or
rust or anything else that I ought not. I
shall visit Whitbury, too, from time to time
to see after my property there, and renew a
very pleasant acquaintance with the place.
And if, Miss Marjory, I should be blessed
with a family, my first daughter will be called
Marjory; and I have in my mind’s eye one
sponsor, whom I shall humbly request to stand
for her. And if she should by any chance
grow up unmanageable, I shall just send her
off on a visit to her godmother in Whitbury,
to be reduced to order and obedience by the
universal manager.’</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">ewis Belassis</span> did not cease
his visits to Ladywell because
Maud had rejected him. On the
contrary, he came as often as ever, and was
made decidedly more welcome than he had
been before.</p>

<p>He was in no way put out by the arrival of
the new Philip Debenham, and even heard
with equanimity the news of Maud’s engagement
to Tor.</p>

<p>Phil liked this cousin of his, Belassis though
he was, and Lewis liked Phil and admired
him. He felt that he had more in common
with him than with Tor, and so he came a
good deal to Ladywell.</p>

<p>What he did with himself during the busy
days which followed Phil’s sudden arrival,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
nobody seemed quite to know. He was often
about the place, that was certain, and frequently
dropped in to lunch; but neither
Phil nor Tor, Maud, Miss Marjory nor Mrs.
Lorraine, saw much of him at other times,
although they all declared with one voice that
they thought the young man had very much
improved of late. Nobody was specially interested
in Lewis, so far as they knew.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory had not left Ladywell yet,
though she had made an attempt to do so,
saying that her work was done, and that she
ought now to be at home. Phil and Tor,
however, had combined to entreat her to stay
at least another week, and she had consented,
without any great amount of persuasion.</p>

<p>One day, as she happened to be looking out
of her window over the gardens, she saw a
sight which at once arrested her attention.</p>

<p>It was not any very uncommon sight
certainly, and one which was frequently to be
seen at Ladywell at that time—a young man
and a young girl walking together, absorbed
in earnest conversation; and yet it set Miss
Marjory thinking, and as she thought, a little
frown knitted her brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>Half an hour later she heard a footfall outside
her door, and called out:</p>

<p>‘Ethel!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Cousin Marjory.’</p>

<p>‘Come in—I want you.’</p>

<p>So Ethel came in, her blooming face somewhat
more blooming than usual, and a little
smile of happiness sparkling in her blue
eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory’s face lost its look of gravity,
and she smiled too. Sometimes Miss Marjory
had been known to say of herself, that she did
not feel as though she should ever be really
old. In heart, she was still young.</p>

<p>‘Where have you been, Ethel?’</p>

<p>‘In the garden.’</p>

<p>‘Were you alone there?’</p>

<p>‘N—no!’—here the colour deepened somewhat,
but Ethel looked up fearlessly and
frankly, and added: ‘Mr. Lewis Belassis was
with me.’</p>

<p>‘He has often been with you lately, has he
not?’</p>

<p>‘Ye—yes, Cousin Marjory, rather often.
You see, everybody is so taken up just now!
There is nobody else for him to talk to!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>Miss Marjory smiled, and then her face grew
grave.</p>

<p>‘Has he been making love to you, Ethel?’</p>

<p>Her face grew rosy red.</p>

<p>‘I—I hardly know—not exactly; but I
think—I can’t help fancying——’</p>

<p>‘That will do, child; you needn’t tell me
any more.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory sat so still for a few minutes—so
still, and so thoughtful—that Ethel, after
looking at her once or twice, began to grow
nervous.</p>

<p>‘You are not angry, Cousin Marjory?’</p>

<p>‘No, child, not angry; but I wish, all the
same, that it hadn’t happened—not just yet,
at any rate,’ she added, catching the look on
Ethel’s face.</p>

<p>‘Cousin Marjory, we couldn’t help it—indeed
we couldn’t! Please don’t say we
mustn’t!’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory smiled, and shook her head.</p>

<p>‘My dear child, I have no authority over
you. You are of age, and your father is
alive; and now that he has married again,
and has made new ties, I do not imagine he
will seriously oppose your choice, provided it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
seems at all suitable. You have your own independent
fortune, even if it is not a very
large one. I have no right to lay a veto on
your marriage.’</p>

<p>‘But I hope you will like it, Cousin Marjory!’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory laughed a little.</p>

<p>‘To speak the truth, Ethel, I have never
looked forward to having very much in common
with your husband, or with Horace’s wife;
so you need not be disappointed on that
score.’</p>

<p>Ethel opened her blue eyes wide. She was
not quite equal to taking in the full meaning
of Miss Marjory’s remark.</p>

<p>‘I thought you liked Lewis!’</p>

<p>‘I think, considering his parentage and
bringing up, he is a marvel; but I don’t
know anything specially remarkable about him
otherwise.’</p>

<p>‘He is very nice!’ said Ethel meekly, feeling
that she was making but a poor champion
for the man whom she really loved fondly.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory sat with knitted brow,
wrapped in thought of no very pleasant
kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>‘Don’t set your heart too much upon this
man, Ethel.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Cousin Marjory! Why not?’</p>

<p>‘It may be impossible for him to marry
you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Cousin Marjory! I thought you said
you would not forbid it!’</p>

<p>‘It will be no doing of mine, child. But,
as I said before, it may be an impossibility
for all that. Now don’t begin to cry. I have
not said that it cannot go on, only that it
may not be able to do so. Lewis would be
the first to tell you so himself, if he knew
what I know.’</p>

<p>‘What is that?’</p>

<p>‘Never mind; it does not concern you. Be
a brave woman, Ethel, and not a child! So
you are quite sure that this Lewis wants to
marry you?’</p>

<p>‘I am almost sure.’</p>

<p>‘Has he asked you?’</p>

<p>‘Not quite.’</p>

<p>‘But almost?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘And you have almost answered him?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>‘That sort of thing wouldn’t suit me,’ said
Miss Marjory. ‘When I was young, we didn’t
do things by halves as you do now. When
I was your age, men asked the plain question,
and got a straight answer—very straight
it generally was, if I remember right! However,
times change, and so do people and their
ways. Well, well! if you don’t mind shilly-shallying,
I don’t see why I need. Has he
got anything to marry on—this Lewis of
yours?’</p>

<p>‘Not very much without Maud’s money,
and he isn’t going to touch that. He is very
high-principled, Cousin Marjory. He is going
to give that all back, as soon as it is made
over to him.’</p>

<p>‘Well, that is honourable enough. I like
him for that. He has not a ghost of a right
to that money, though it is legally his. Well,
and when he makes over that, what has he
left?’</p>

<p>‘Only about a hundred a year—something
an uncle left him once. I have three hundred
a year, you know, Cousin Marjory; and I have
not spent nearly that whilst I have been living
with you. Lewis doesn’t think his father will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
do anything for him, after he has given over
Maud’s money, he will be so angry; but
he means to try and get something to do.
I thought—we thought—you know you
said——’</p>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">‘Said I would help him to something?</span><br />
Well, I’ll do what I can, if he shows himself
worthy. I’ll do that in any case, whether
you marry him or not, for he’ll need a helping
hand. I can’t say I like the idea of your
marrying a Belassis; but, as I said before,
that’s not my business, and no good ever
comes of trying to shape out other people’s
lives for them. But mind what I say, don’t
be led on past recall, and don’t pledge yourself,
or set your heart on it yet. It may
be impossible.’

<p>‘Oh, I hope not!’</p>

<p>‘I hope not too.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you tell me more, Cousin Marjory?’</p>

<p>‘No, not now, child; but I hope to be able
to do so shortly.’</p>

<p>Lewis Belassis was wandering aimlessly
along a field-path, not very far from Ladywell,
and indulging in a dream of a brighter future
than had ever before seemed to await him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
when he was accosted by a respectable-looking
man, who had the air and appearance of a
well-to-do tradesman.</p>

<p>‘If you please, sir, can you direct me to
Ladywell Manor?’ said the man.</p>

<p>Lewis eyed him curiously, for there was an
odd resemblance to his father in the man’s
voice and appearance, which suggested to his
mind the fanciful idea that he might be a poor
relation, who had been studiously kept in the
background all this while, and whose very
existence was unknown to him.</p>

<p>It would be just like his father to be
ashamed of a poor kinsman, Lewis thought;
but the resemblance was not strong enough
to afford any real reason for the fancy thus
conjured up.</p>

<p>‘Ladywell Manor—yes, certainly, you can
get to it this way; but the field-paths are
rather intricate, and you would most likely
stray. If you’ll walk to the end of the field
with me, I can put you into a much more
direct way of finding it.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir,’ said the man, and turned
back readily.</p>

<p>‘I’ve just come from Ladywell,’ remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
Lewis, inwardly wondering what could be the
man’s business there. ‘It’s a fine old place.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir? I’m a stranger in these parts. I
come from Whitbury; it is Miss Marjory Descartes
that I’ve come to see. She’s our great
lady at Whitbury.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ said Lewis, his first faint impression
dying away; ‘she’s a great lady, I fancy,
wherever she goes.’</p>

<p>‘Like enough, sir,’ answered the other; and
they walked on in silence.</p>

<p>As they reached the road, two friends of
Lewis’s rode by.</p>

<p>‘How do, Belassis?’ said one.</p>

<p>‘Morning, Belassis,’ said the other.</p>

<p>Then the strange man turned and looked
at him.</p>

<p>‘Is your name Belassis, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, certainly.’</p>

<p>Lewis’s first suspicion woke again into new
life.</p>

<p>‘So is mine,’ said the man—‘Alfred Belassis.’</p>

<p>‘Why, I thought there was something of a
Belassis look about you,’ said Lewis heartily,
for he was not a cad, and was above coldshouldering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
a poor relation. ‘Shake hands;
I fancy we are some sort of cousins. I’ll walk
your way, and we’ll find out.’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir,’ said the man slowly, ‘if you’re
the son of Mr. Alfred Belassis of these parts,
maybe I’d best walk your way, and see him.’</p>

<p>‘You are a relation of ours, then?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir; and I’m afraid, perhaps, a nearer
one than you’ll quite relish.’</p>

<p>Lewis laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>‘Never mind my father—he always was a
growler, as I dare say you know; but so far
as I am concerned, you will be very welcome.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir; you mean kindly, I see,
only you don’t know yet who I am.’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t; but I wish you’d tell me.’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, I’m your half-brother—if you
want to know.’</p>

<p>‘My—half—brother!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. I’m afraid you won’t like it; but
I’ve not come here to force myself upon you,
or make myself unpleasant. I’ve got a word
to say to my father, whom I never knew; and
when I’ve said it, I’ll go. He’ll be glad of my
message, even if he isn’t glad to see his own
son.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>‘My half-brother!’ repeated Lewis once
more, with even greater astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir; Mr. Alfred Belassis married my
mother before he married yours.’</p>

<p>‘I never knew he had a first wife! I don’t
believe anyone knew.’</p>

<p>‘Like enough, sir. He behaved real bad,
he did—deserted my mother less than three
months after he married her, and never sent
her word or line, or took the least bit of notice
of her. She thought he had died, and sort of
believed in him all along, I’ve heard tell. But
Miss Marjory had me brought up—my poor
mother was always weakly; and she told me
the whole story when I grew up. We’ve got
a bad father, you and I have, sir.’</p>

<p>‘My name is Lewis. If we are brothers,
you should not call me “sir,”’ said Lewis, feeling,
as he had often felt of late, that his father
was a despicable character.</p>

<p>‘I know my place, sir,’ answered the man,
not without dignity. ‘I like you for not
flying out, because we’ve got the same father;
but we’ve been brought up different. You’re
a gentleman, whilst I keep a shop. I’ve
made a tidy lot of money in business; but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
know my place, and I know I’m not like
you.’</p>

<p>‘You may thank your stars you’re not,’
said poor Lewis. ‘It seems to me I’ve
nothing to call my own, but the name my
father has disgraced.’</p>

<p>‘We needn’t disgrace it, sir,’ said the man
respectfully. ‘I never was ashamed of it—downright
ashamed—till I got a letter from
Miss Marjory a week ago.’</p>

<p>‘And what did that tell you?’</p>

<p>‘Why, that your father, sir—and mine—didn’t
ever trouble to find out that my poor
mother was dead, before he married yours.
He does not even know now that she is his
lawful wife.’</p>

<p>Lewis flushed hotly.</p>

<p>‘But she is?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, she is: I’d not have liked to come
here and face you all, if things had turned out
different; but it is all right in that sense,
though he don’t really know it. Miss Marjory,
she wrote and told me about things here, and
bid me try to find out the exact date of my
mother’s death, from the people who brought
me up. She thought they’d be most likely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
know. They didn’t know exactly, but I got
to know the place where she died, and I went
down to see the registers and find out. She
died on the 2nd of May, 1850, and Mr. Belassis
married again about a fortnight later. But
he didn’t know anything about this death.’</p>

<p>Lewis walked on in silence. He felt very
much inclined not to go home at all, after
what he had just heard, so profoundly disgusted
was he with his father; but on the
whole he decided that he would do so, and
take this elder brother with him.</p>

<p>It was luncheon-time when he arrived, and
they were a little late, so that the servant had
withdrawn.</p>

<p>Lewis entered boldly, with the young tradesman
close behind him.</p>

<p>‘Allow me,’ said he to his father, ‘to introduce
to you your first-born son, Alfred
Belassis.’</p>

<p>Matilda and Bertha screamed, Mrs. Belassis
turned pale, her husband purple.</p>

<p>‘D—— your impudence!’ he cried, starting
up. ‘What do you mean by coming here with
such a story? I’ll kick you out of my house
if you dare ever enter it again!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>It seemed uncertain to which of the two
sons the threat was made. The elder one
took it as addressed to him.</p>

<p>‘I’ve no particular wish ever to come again,
sir. I am not proud of the relationship, and
I don’t care to claim it. I only came now to
bring you something which I think you may
like to possess;’ and he took from his pocket-book
and handed to Mr. Belassis a certified copy
of the register of the death of his first wife.</p>

<p>He took it, looked at it, and handed it
across to his wife. An immense load seemed
lifted at once from his shoulders; but instead
of feeling any gratitude towards the man who
had brought the good news, or any spark of
affection for the son of whose very existence
he had not been aware till now, he was only
filled with a burning rage against anyone
who had dared to bring home to him, and in
a manner to make public, the most disgraceful
episode of his early life.</p>

<p>He was too angry even to consider his own
interests, or to try and conciliate the man who
possessed knowledge so much to his discredit.
He turned furiously upon Alfred Belassis, and
swore at him more loudly than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>‘Get out of my house, you blackguard!
coming forcing your way in under false pretences,
and making up scandalous stories to
extort money! I know the ways of gentlemen
like you; and if you don’t make the best of
your way out double-quick, I’ll have you kicked
out by the servants!’</p>

<p>But Lewis laid his hand upon his half-brother’s
arm to detain him.</p>

<p>‘This man is your son as much as I am!’
said he boldly. ‘He is my brother, and I
won’t stand by and hear him insulted! If
you turn him out of your house, I shall go
too!’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis smiled contemptuously. She
thought her son was only making himself
ridiculous, and she considered the presence
of that other man in the room a positive
insult to herself.</p>

<p>‘You can go to the devil, both of you!’
growled Belassis fiercely. ‘What do I care?’</p>

<p>Lewis took Alfred’s arm, and led him from
the room and from the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis smiled even more contemptuously.</p>

<p>‘He will come back to-morrow like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
whipped puppy, with his tail between his
legs.’</p>

<p>‘What does it all mean?’ asked Bertha.
‘Why do you and papa always quarrel with
everybody? Who is that man?’</p>

<p>‘A distant relative of your father’s, who is
very troublesome and pushing. We have
helped him till we are tired, and now, I
think, he will come no more,’ answered Mrs.
Belassis grandly.</p>

<p>‘Why did Lewis say——’</p>

<p>‘Lewis is a fool!’ snapped Mr. Belassis;
and then he added, a little uneasily: ‘but I
don’t want to quarrel with him, for all that.’</p>

<p>He looked at his wife, who merely smiled,
and said:</p>

<p>‘You need not be afraid of Lewis. I can
turn him round my little finger!’</p>

<p>The relief given by this certificate was
intense, to the proud, hard woman who had
ruled at Thornton House with a rod of iron.
Her contempt for the husband she had married
was unbounded; but, at least, she was his
lawful wife, and therefore policy bound her
over to his cause. She knew quite well why
Lewis must be kept in a good humour; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
his father’s good name was at his mercy, or
would be very shortly, when the handing-over
of Maud’s trust-money could no longer
be delayed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis, however, had small opinion of
Lewis’s force of character, and attached no
importance to this foolish quarrel.</p>

<p>As the newly-acquainted brothers walked
across the park towards Ladywell, Alfred
said:</p>

<p>‘You shouldn’t have quarrelled with them
for my sake, sir.’</p>

<p>‘I wasn’t going to stand seeing you treated
like that! You’re as much his son as I am!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, true enough; but, of course,
things have changed; and he doesn’t like to
be made to think of the past.’</p>

<p>‘He needn’t have insulted you.’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, he needn’t; but when a man’s
temper is up, he doesn’t pick his words. We’d
better have had it out more quiet-like, without
the missis and the young ladies sitting by.’</p>

<p>‘Well, one can’t think of everything, and
truth’s truth. I know I should have quarrelled
with him sooner or later; it doesn’t much
matter how it happened.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>‘But you’ll make it up again, surely, sir?’</p>

<p>‘I wish you wouldn’t call me “sir.” I don’t
know if I shall make it up. We’ve got a
quarrel brewing on our own account. There’s
a lot of money come to me by law, which isn’t
mine by right—only by a piece of trickery.
I’m not going to keep it. I’m going to give
it back to the rightful owner, and my father
will be furious—I know he will.’</p>

<p>‘And when you’ve given up the money,
and quarrelled with your father, how are you
going to live, if I may be so bold as to ask?’</p>

<p>‘I must earn my living somehow—sweep a
crossing if need be. Well, no, I’ve got just
enough to keep me above that; and I hope to
get a decent berth of some kind, if such a
thing’s to be had. I did want to get married’—here
Lewis sighed—‘but, of course, that
must wait till I’ve something to marry upon—eh,
Alfred?’</p>

<p>He found it easier to talk to this friendly
tradesman-relative of his affairs, than he would
have done had he been of equal social standing.
There was a straightforward honesty
about the man which pleased him.</p>

<p>Alfred seemed to ponder for a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>‘You see, sir, it wants capital in these days
to get a good berth—unless one’s a lad, and
can work up from the bottom. Right must
be done, but you’d have found the money very
useful.’</p>

<p>‘I know that well enough,’ sighed Lewis;
‘but I can’t rob my own cousin of what would
have been hers, but for my father’s scheming.
They all say it was that, and I believe it.’</p>

<p>‘No, sir; I see you couldn’t. I don’t believe
riches got like that ever prosper. Well, we’ll
see what can be done. You’ve stood by me
like a brother, and it would be a poor return
if I couldn’t do the same by you.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks, Alfred,’ said Lewis; but he smiled
inwardly, wondering how this shopkeeper
brother’s support could be of any assistance to
him.</p>

<small>LEWIS’S FATE.</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/i_t.jpg" alt="T" /></div>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">he</span> arrival of Lewis with Alfred
Belassis at Ladywell that day,
caused a considerable amount of
speculation and astonishment.</p>

<p>When, in addition, Lewis announced the
fact that he had quarrelled with his father, and
meant to return no more to Thornton House,
quite a sensation was produced; and Miss
Marjory did not hesitate to tell him that she
considered he had judged wisely and well.</p>

<p>‘You shall stay here, old fellow,’ said Phil
warmly, ‘till we can find you a berth of some
kind; and don’t you be in any hurry. Give
yourself plenty of time to look round; something
good will be sure to turn up if you do.
You’ve behaved like a brick about that money,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
and the least we can do is to make you some
return.’</p>

<p>‘The money wasn’t mine, as you all know,’
said Lewis. ‘I hope I know better than to
profit by a low trick like that, even though
my father was the one who practised it.’</p>

<p>‘I think we ought to divide it,’ said Maud,
‘just in case papa did mean some of it for
you.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory had beckoned Alfred Belassis
to her side. Mrs. Lorraine was standing near,
looking anxious. She knew on what errand
he had come.</p>

<p>‘Have you found out about your mother’s
death?’ she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>‘Yes; it was on the 2nd of May, 1850.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Miss Marjory, ‘I’m glad to
hear it, for the sake of the innocent, who
would suffer more than the guilty; but he
drove it close enough. What a miserable
coward he is!’</p>

<p>Alfred Belassis stood silent, looking and
feeling rather awkward, in the midst of such a
company.</p>

<p>‘I should like to speak a word to you in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
private, ma’am,’ he said, ‘if it isn’t troubling
you too much. I ought to be getting back to
Whitbury as fast as I can, now that I’ve done
what you asked.’</p>

<p>‘Come into this room, then,’ said Miss
Marjory, opening a door which stood near.
‘Let me hear what it is you have to say.’</p>

<p>Belassis followed her in, and sat down at
her bidding. He was a thick-set, clever-looking
man, with more honesty than beauty
to recommend him.</p>

<p>‘Well, Belassis,’ said Miss Marjory, ‘what
is it?’</p>

<p>‘If you please, ma’am, I want to know if I
couldn’t be of some use to that young gentleman
there, who is a sort of brother to me,
after all.’</p>

<p>‘Lewis, you mean? Well, I don’t know
exactly how you could serve him. I’m afraid
he would be little good to you as a partner.’</p>

<p>Alfred Belassis looked almost shocked.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, ma’am; of course I couldn’t think
of such a thing. A young gentleman like
him could never take to trade; it wouldn’t be
right nor proper. I know better than that;
but he’s had education, you know, and advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
of other kinds, and I’m thinking
something might be found for him more suitable.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory reflected. She, too, could not
be indifferent now to the future of Lewis
Belassis.</p>

<p>‘They tell me he has good abilities. He
might perhaps get on in some line, if he had a
fair start. I don’t mind doing my best for
him; but in what way did you mean to help,
Belassis?’</p>

<p>‘With money, ma’am. A deal more can be
done for a man who’s got a few thousands at
his back, than one who has only got his brains
to look to. I should like to see to the money
part of it—because, you know, he’s my brother
after a fashion.’</p>

<p>‘This is very generous of you, Belassis;
but are you a man of means?’</p>

<p>‘Thanks to you, ma’am, I’ve done very
well. You got me the place of assistant
to Mr. Hanly when I was but eighteen, and I
succeeded to the business when I was five-and-twenty.
You stood my friend, and I never
wanted for work; and things have been growing
and growing, until I’ve almost more to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
than I know how to get through sometimes.
I’m a plain man myself, and I’ve never
married; and the money has all gone into the
bank, and been invested from time to time.
There’s three thousand as I can lay my hands
upon any day, and not leave myself pinched.
I’d as soon Mr. Lewis had it to help him to a
start, as spend it any other way. So if any
good thing turns up as wants a little capital
launched, you know where the money’s to
come from. I think that’s all, ma’am. I
won’t detain you longer. I could best speak
out to you, because I don’t feel so strange like
with you, as I do with the other folks in
there.’</p>

<p>‘Stop—stop, Belassis! not quite so fast!’
cried Miss Marjory. ‘This is very generous
of you, but really I’m not sure if you should
do it. Suppose he is very long in repaying
you.’</p>

<p>‘I was not thinking about repayment,’ said
Belassis. ‘I’d risk the chance of that.’</p>

<p>‘But really, Belassis, you must be practical,
and consider what you are doing. Three
thousand is a large sum, and Lewis has no
claim upon you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, ma’am, he wasn’t ashamed to own
me as his brother, nor to stand by me like a
brother when the old man swore at us. It
isn’t every young gentleman as would have
cared to accept a man like me as a relation, on
my bare word; and it ain’t many as would
have stood up for me as he did.’</p>

<p>‘He behaved well towards you, I admit;
but still——’</p>

<p>‘I ought to do well by him, then. I never
knew before as I’d got a brother, and it’ll be
a real pleasure if I can help him. I’m a plain
man, and I don’t love money for its own sake.
I’d much rather it was helping Mr. Lewis,
than lying by idle at the bank. Will you
let him know about it, if ever he wants it to
make his start?’</p>

<p>‘Well, if you’re bent on it, Belassis, I’ll
say no more. But won’t you tell Lewis
yourself?’</p>

<p>‘I’d sooner you did it, ma’am. It’s rather
early days for me to speak, and we don’t
know yet what he’ll want, or even if he wants
anything. He may make it up with his
father, and not want any help. I’d sooner
leave it in your hands, if you please. Mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
you let him know that it doesn’t matter at all
about paying it back. I don’t want him
hampered by debt. I’d sooner give it outright.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Belassis, Belassis! And you call yourself
a man of business!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, ma’am, and so I am; but this isn’t
business at all, and I don’t want it to be.
The poor young gentleman is worse off, to my
thinking, than if he’d got no father; and I’m
his elder brother, and he’s accepted me as one,
only thinking me a poor shopkeeper. I should
like to play an elder brother’s part, and it
isn’t a matter of business at all.’</p>

<p>He got up as he said the last words, and
Miss Marjory followed his example.</p>

<p>‘Well, you talk like an honest and kind-hearted
man, Belassis, and your brother ought
to be proud of the relationship.’</p>

<p>‘Good-day, then, ma’am. I must be getting
back to Whitbury now. You’ll kindly see
after things for me here, I know.’</p>

<p>So Alfred Belassis escaped from Ladywell,
Lewis walking with him part of the way to
the station.</p>

<p>‘I should like to come and see you, Alfred,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
one of these days,’ said Lewis. ‘You’re the
only relation I am likely to see much of for
some time to come. Have you any objection
to a visit?’</p>

<p>‘I shall be honoured by your presence, sir.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid it won’t confer much honour;
but I should like to see Whitbury, and call
upon Miss Marjory, and—and—I mean, see
her in her own house.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>And so they parted, the elder man taking
his way towards the inn and the coach-road,
and Lewis standing at the corner, looking
doubtful and irresolute.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I’d better go back and have it out
at once. It must be said sooner or later, and
I have my traps to collect. I don’t see any
use in putting off the evil day; it must come
sometime. I’ll go straight up and have done
with it.’</p>

<p>And he turned his steps towards Thornton
House.</p>

<p>He did not seek his father at once upon
his arrival, but went straight up to his own
room. All his possessions there were his own
property, for his uncle’s legacy had supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
him with funds for his personal wants ever
since he was of age, and therefore he had the
entire right to claim as his own all that was
there.</p>

<p>He packed up in his portmanteaux everything
that he valued or that could be of any
use in the future, and then he rang and ordered
the man to carry down the boxes by the
back staircase, and get them conveyed to
Ladywell.</p>

<p>This packing-up had occupied more than
two hours, and Mr. and Mrs. Belassis, who
had seen from the window their son’s arrival,
smiled a little to themselves at his speedy
return, and at the quiet way in which it had
been effected.</p>

<p>‘I told you he would come back like a
whipped puppy,’ said Mrs. Belassis. ‘I do
not think we shall have any further trouble
with Lewis.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure I hope not,’ sighed the husband.
‘I’ve had enough trouble these past months
to carry a man into his grave. But I
do think when we’ve searched Ladywell
and found that will, we really shall have no
more to fear. You’re sure Betsy Long is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
to be trusted to let us in and to hold her
tongue?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes! I make it well worth her while.
She loves money far too well to betray us.
We can spend as many nights as we like in
the library, and nobody be any the wiser.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ and Belassis drew a long breath, ‘it
really seems as if things were coming right at
last!’</p>

<p>And then the door opened, and Lewis came
in.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir!’ said the father grandly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis folded her hands with a smile,
and added, interrogatively:</p>

<p>‘Well, Lewis?’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, I’ve come to say a rather less
hasty good-bye; and to tell you of a resolution
I have taken.’</p>

<p>Both countenances changed slightly.</p>

<p>‘Say good-bye!’ echoed Belassis, with the
ghost of a laugh. ‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be a fool, Lewis,’ advised his mother
concisely.</p>

<p>‘I’m going to stay at Ladywell until I can
find something to do, for I’m sick of the life
here, and don’t mean to stay to be ordered out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
of the house a second time. People there are
very kind, and I shall be sure to find some
sort of a berth before very long. Now I want
to know when that ten thousand pounds, with
interest and compound interest for eighteen
years, will be paid in to me?’</p>

<p>Mr. Belassis sat silent; his jaw had fallen
somewhat, his eyes were full of anxiety. His
wife spoke in his place:</p>

<p>‘Why do you ask?’</p>

<p>‘I should have thought it was a very
natural question. As Maud is to be married
to some one else very shortly, I should think
the money might be paid up at once.’</p>

<p>‘It will be paid when your father thinks
right.’</p>

<p>‘That won’t quite do for me,’ said Lewis
boldly; ‘the money is mine, and I want it.
I want to get the transfer made out, and the
thing off my mind, before I make my own
start. Now, sir, will you kindly tell me what
you mean to do?’</p>

<p>‘The transfer!’ gasped Belassis; ‘what the
devil do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘I thought I had made myself plain the
other night,’ said Lewis. ‘The money is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Maud’s, not mine, and I shall simply transfer
it to her.’</p>

<p>‘You will do no such thing, Lewis,’ said
Mrs. Belassis, with significance.</p>

<p>‘I shall do it!’ said Lewis firmly. ‘Everybody
knows it, and I shall stand by my
word.’</p>

<p>‘You will have no power to do so,’
answered the mother. ‘You had better have
held your tongue about it, as I advised you.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘I mean that there is no money to receive.
Your clever and honest father has speculated
with it—and lost it. That is all.’</p>

<p>Lewis stood still in astonishment and dismay.</p>

<p>‘But I can claim it—he is bound to repay
it!’</p>

<p>‘If you choose you can, of course; but you
will not. Maud’s five thousand must be paid,
and will be, though it is a serious loss to us;
but you will never see a penny of yours.’</p>

<p>‘It is not mine, it is Maud’s. I shall
claim it for her. She shall not be fleeced
like this!’</p>

<p>‘Claim it, then, and bring ruin and disgrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
upon your father! It will be a noble
part from a son!’</p>

<p>‘Has not my father brought disgrace upon
himself without anyone’s help? Has he not
nearly brought upon you, and upon me, the
worst disgrace which the world holds? It is
no doing of his that I am not at present a
nameless outcast—it is merely a chance for
which we have to thank fortune, and not him.
And he appeals to me to save him from
disgrace! I will not listen! I will have
justice! It is he who has disgraced himself,
not I!’</p>

<p>‘Lewis, consider!’ began Mrs. Belassis, who,
though she cared little for her husband, and
heartily despised him, had no wish to see him
disgraced and impoverished in order to swell
the wealth of Maud and Torwood.</p>

<p>‘I will consider nothing but justice! I
will have what is legally mine, in order to
give it to her whose right it is. My father
deserves no mercy at my hands, and he shall
not get it!’</p>

<p>‘This, then, is my reward for scheming and
sinning for your future happiness!’ burst out
Belassis, in an agony of rage and fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>‘More shame for you to have so schemed
and sinned,’ answered Lewis; but his indignation
had cooled somewhat, and it was easy to
see that he took no pleasure in the thought
of bringing ruin and disgrace upon his own
house.</p>

<p>‘Lewis,’ said Mrs. Belassis coldly and calmly,
‘you have spoken the truth—your father deserves
no mercy at your hands. He had, for
aught he knew at the time, committed the vilest
action a man could perpetrate. He is disgraced,
as you say, already, and the story of
crime will be all over the place to-morrow.
Ruin and disgrace he heartily merits; but
what about me?’</p>

<p>‘You, mother?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I am your mother. I shall be involved
in whatever ruin and disgrace overtakes your
father—I and your sisters both. You must
think of that, before you take any irrevocable
step.’</p>

<p>Lewis stood silent.</p>

<p>‘I have had a good deal to bear already as
the fruit of your father’s misconduct; but we
have contrived to weather matters pretty well
up till now. If you strike this threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
blow, however, all is lost, and you will be the
ruin of your whole family.’</p>

<p>Still Lewis said nothing.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she asked, after a pause, ‘what have
you to say now?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing?’</p>

<p>‘No; I must think.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you had better think,’ said Mrs. Belassis,
knowing well that reflection was likely to
be favourable to her own cause.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ he said suddenly. ‘I shall be
at Ladywell for some time to come, I expect.’</p>

<p>And then he turned and quitted the room,
without another word.</p>

<p>‘He is safe,’ said Mrs. Belassis; ‘he will
not do it now. We are safe, so far as he is
concerned.’</p>

<p>Lewis went back to Ladywell, and told his
story in confidence to Miss Marjory. People
had a way of going to Miss Marjory when they
were in doubt or perplexity, because such feelings
seemed unknown to her.</p>

<p>She listened intently, and then abused Belassis
with all the force of her emphatic vocabulary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>‘What must I do?’ asked Lewis. ‘Must I
denounce and ruin him?’</p>

<p>‘He deserves it,’ answered Miss Marjory
hotly. ‘He deserves it richly; but a man’s
mother, Lewis, is his mother, and his first
duty is to protect her.’</p>

<p>And to the son Miss Marjory breathed none
of the suspicions she had formed as to the
mother’s integrity. As she afterwards told
Tor, she was old-fashioned enough to think
that loyalty to a mother stood before every
other claim.</p>

<p>‘Well, yes, I suppose it does,’ said Lewis
gravely. ‘I can’t help feeling it myself.
I’ve not been so fond of her as I ought,
perhaps; but she’s my mother still, and it
doesn’t seem fair that she should suffer so
much for what my father has done. But I
should have liked Maud to have her own.’</p>

<p>‘So should I. It would be a nice little
fortune for her; but I don’t see your way
quite clear, though your father deserves no
mercy. However, I’m glad to know that
you did really mean to make restitution of
what you felt did not rightly belong to you.
It is much to your credit.—And so you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
been making love to my young cousin, I
understand, under my very nose?’</p>

<p>Poor Lewis flushed scarlet at this sudden
and totally unexpected thrust.</p>

<p>‘I—I— Was it very wrong? I couldn’t
help feeling——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, keep your feelings for Ethel. I’m not
at all interested in them. What I want to know
is, what your future prospects are?’</p>

<p>‘Bad, I’m afraid,’ said Lewis candidly;
‘much worse than when I began to speak to
your cousin; for I’ve quarrelled with my father,
and he has been playing fast and loose with
his money, I suspect. But I might get something
in time, if Ethel could wait. She said
she would——’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, I dare say she will. She’s a faithful
little puss, and very steady and affectionate.
But you must look about you seriously. Have
you any plans?’</p>

<p>Lewis shook his head; and then Miss Marjory,
after putting him through an examination
on his acquirements, which he got through
fairly well, informed him that she would
write to an old friend of hers in London,
who had a publishing business of a lucrative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
kind, and had been meditating taking in a
young partner. He was childless, and a
widower to boot, and such a berth was likely
to be a good one. Miss Marjory and he were
old friends, and he had known Ethel’s father
and mother.</p>

<p>Lewis was delighted. Such an opening was
just what he wanted, and from what he could
learn from Miss Marjory, the duties were of a
kind which he would be able to master without
great difficulty, and would be congenial to him.
His spirits rose greatly, and he overwhelmed
Miss Marjory with thanks; and by her permission
went in search of Ethel.</p>

<p>The answer to Miss Marjory’s letter was
eagerly awaited. It came promptly, and was
favourable to Miss Marjory’s young friend,
who was invited to go to London for a personal
interview. Of course it was expected that he
would have a few thousands to put into the
business, in return for a junior partnership and
its prospects.</p>

<p>Lewis’s face fell when he read this final
clause.</p>

<p>With a great sigh he handed back the
letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>‘Thank you very much, Miss Marjory; but
of course that puts it out of the question.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all. You have three thousand to
back you. I dare say that will be enough.’</p>

<p>‘You are joking, Miss Marjory. What little
I have of my own is only mine in trust. I
cannot sink the principal; and then it would
not come to three thousand.’</p>

<p>‘I was not thinking of your own money.’</p>

<p>‘What then?’</p>

<p>‘Of what your brother—half-brother, I
should say—wishes to advance for you, to
give you a start in life. He left it for me to
tell you, if it should be necessary. Alfred
Belassis is anxious to give or lend you that
amount of money. You must settle between
yourselves which it is to be.’</p>

<p>‘Alfred Belassis!’ cried Lewis, astonished.
‘Why, he is only a shopkeeper!’</p>

<p>‘Some shopkeepers make large fortunes.
Trade is more lucrative than the gentlemanly
professions.’</p>

<p>‘I had no idea he had money.’</p>

<p>‘I know, and so did he; and he thought all
the better of you because you did not know.
After all, Lewis, there is some good in you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
and it seems to me that you are on the highroad
to success.’</p>

<p>‘But ought I to take it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, settle all that with Alfred. You had
better go and see him, before going to London.
I would start to-day if I were you. Time is
valuable, you know.’</p>

<p>Lewis received very warm congratulations
from all at Ladywell, on his sudden good
fortune; and Maud was particularly delighted,
only second to Ethel in her satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘It is all Miss Marjory’s doing,’ she cried.
‘It seems to me everything is Miss Marjory’s
doing. Tor always did say you could do anything
you had a mind to, and I believe you
can. I know you told me my fortune wonderfully
well.’</p>

<p>So great satisfaction reigned at Ladywell,
and Lewis, in high spirits, set out on his
journey.</p>

<p>The result was satisfactory, and a good
position in the publishing firm was given to
him, and his engagement to Ethel Hardcastle
formally announced.</p>

<p>Lewis, for the first time in his life, found
himself a busy and a happy man.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">hil</span> and Tor had sat up late one
night, as was often the case, and it
was not until nearly one o’clock
that they retired to their respective rooms.</p>

<p>When Tor reached his, he found that a fall
of soot had taken place, which had blackened
things so much, and left so unpleasant an
odour in the room, that to remain there was
impossible.</p>

<p>It was too late to disturb the servants, or
to have another room made ready for him;
but Tor was too much the traveller to care
where or how he slept. He merely made his
way to an empty bedroom, kicked off his
boots, and lay down upon the bed in the
smoking-coat he had previously donned.</p>

<p>In five minutes he was sound asleep, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
the facility of one used to ‘roughing it;’ but
with the instinct of a man not unused to
danger, he suddenly woke up, with all his
faculties about him, and presently became
aware of curious sounds in the room beneath
him.</p>

<p>A moment’s thought convinced him that
these sounds, whatever they were, came from
the library, which was directly underneath the
room he accidentally occupied, and which lay
in a wing of the building not much used.</p>

<p>There were certainly sounds proceeding
from the room below; the longer Tor listened
the more was he convinced of this—stealthy
sounds, which he could not exactly understand,
yet which were, from time to time,
distinctly audible.</p>

<p>After a few minutes spent in listening, Tor
rose, and without resuming his boots, passed
quietly from the room. A dying moon gave
a feeble light to corridor and staircase; and
after a visit to his own room to fetch his
revolver, the young man walked silently down
to the library.</p>

<p>The door stood slightly ajar, as if the
occupants, whoever they might be, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
anxious to hear if any sound should arise in
the house. Tor, however, took care to make
no noise, and he did not hesitate to push open
the door and slip silently into the room, for
the feeble light the midnight guests had
brought with them was far away at the upper
end, and the door and all in its neighbourhood
lay wrapped in the deepest gloom.</p>

<p>Once inside, Tor looked well at the intruders,
and recognised, with an odd mixture
of feeling, Mr. and Mrs. Belassis.</p>

<p>‘What in the name of all the powers brings
<i>them</i> here?’ he thought, but he stood motionless,
half through surprise, half from an
instinct of caution, which warned him that it
would be wise to find out, if possible, the
reason for this strange nocturnal visit.</p>

<p>Both husband and wife were closely
examining a heavy volume they had lifted
from the shelf. They shook it, examined its
cover, and otherwise pulled it about; after
which it was restored to its place, and the
next volume lifted down, to be submitted to a
similar process.</p>

<p>Tor watched them with a deepening interest.
They seemed so absorbed by their task, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
many minutes passed before either of them
spoke. As, however, Belassis replaced upon a
shelf the last of the volumes it contained, he
sighed heavily, and remarked:</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe we shall ever find it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if we don’t, nobody else will, and
that’s all I care about; but until we have
examined every book the library contains, we
can never feel safe.’</p>

<p>Belassis sighed again.</p>

<p>‘It will be an endless task!’</p>

<p>‘No, only a long one; and we can come here
as often, in reason, as we please; and Betsy
Long can look at the books as she dusts them,
if we can’t get here safely ourselves.’</p>

<p>Tor’s gaze deepened in intensity. Metaphorically
speaking, he pricked up his ears at this.</p>

<p>‘I believe we shall come to grief, somehow.
That girl will betray us.’</p>

<p>‘Not she; she knows better than to forfeit
double wages, and lose both her places.’</p>

<p>But Belassis was not to be comforted.</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe we shall ever do any good
by this; and I’m getting quite done up with
these disturbed nights.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked him all over with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
cold contempt, which seemed to wither him up.
When she spoke, it was with a crushing
disdain.</p>

<p>‘Really, Mr. Belassis, I have half a mind
to take you at your word, and give up this
attempt—and leave others to find Philip
Debenham’s last will. It seems to me that
you would rather live, with total ruin hanging
over your head, than give up a few nights’
rest and take a little trouble. Anyone more
hopelessly pusillanimous, it has never been
my lot to come across!’</p>

<p>‘It seems such a hopeless search, my dear,’
began Belassis feebly. ‘If we really <i>knew</i> the
will was here, it would be different.’</p>

<p>‘We do know it!’ snapped Mrs. Belassis.
‘Philip Debenham told old Tom Maynard that
he had hidden it here. We have that in his own
handwriting. What more do you want?’</p>

<p>‘Old Maynard could never find the will,
though.’</p>

<p>‘Old Maynard had not the same motive that
we have. He would soon grow tired of the
search.’</p>

<p>‘He thought Debenham must have destroyed
it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>‘He did not know what we do.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘He did not know how Philip Debenham
feared, and hated, and distrusted us, during
the last years of his life.’</p>

<p>There was a pause, which Mrs. Belassis
broke.</p>

<p>‘Come, Alfred, do have a little common-sense.
You know, as well as I do, that Philip
Debenham simply made that will at your dictation,
because he was weak and foolish, and
believed you had much more power to do him
mischief than you really had, if he had only
played the man and taken his affairs into his
own hands. We both knew he would not
allow that will to stand, if he could possibly
make another, and we always expected that a
later one would turn up amongst his papers,
and were prepared to act accordingly; but it
did not. Nobody brought one forward, and
we never found any evidence of the existence
of a second will. You know, however, that
we have never felt absolutely at ease on the
subject, although, as years passed by, it
seemed most improbable that anything could
or would turn up. Then, when I found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
letter of old Maynard’s to young Philip, and
discovered the pencil memorandum inside,
which he had never read, it became evident
that our suspicions had all along been correct.
He had made a new will, and had hidden it,
with more cunning than I should have given
him credit for, at Ladywell, out of our reach.
Knowing all this, how can you pretend that it
is not worth searching for?’</p>

<p>‘He might have removed it himself,’ suggested
Belassis humbly.</p>

<p>‘You know better than that. If he had
once found a safe place of hiding, out of your
reach, he would never have been tempted to
remove it. Hating you more and more as he
did at the close of his life, is it likely he would
ever have changed his mind about the will?’</p>

<p>And then the search continued in silence for
a long while, whilst Tor stood concealed in
his recess, watching them with lynx-like
eyes.</p>

<p>He did not choose to leave the room, even
for a moment, lest in that moment the missing
paper should be found. He did not feel inclined,
now that he was no longer master of
the house, to step out and confront them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
demand the reason of this strange nocturnal
visit.</p>

<p>So he waited and watched in silence, for what
seemed a long time, until a faint blue film
stealing into the room, announced the approach
of dawn.</p>

<p>‘We must be going now,’ said Mrs. Belassis.
‘We have done a good two hours’ work, and
have made a considerable way with the task.
Four or five more nights ought to see the
end of it. We have done nearly half in the
four nights we have spent here already. I
wish the light did not come so soon. It is
hardly safe to be abroad after dawn. Come,
Alfred, we must be going.’</p>

<p>Tor slipped away from the room as they
replaced the last volume on the shelf, and
mounted a few steps of the staircase. Two
minutes later Mr. and Mrs. Belassis came out,
and locked the door carefully behind them.
Then they took their way towards the offices,
and Tor followed quietly, at a discreet distance.</p>

<p>Betsy Long emerged from one of the rooms
at the sound of their footsteps, yawning portentously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis slipped something into her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
hand as she passed, and the girl curtseyed and
said:</p>

<p>‘Thank you, ma’am.’</p>

<p>Then the worthy couple made their exit by
the back-door, which Betsy carefully locked
behind them. Turning round, she uttered a
loud scream, for her ex-master stood before
her.</p>

<p>‘Nice goings on, these, Betsy,’ remarked
Tor quietly. ‘What have you got to say for
yourself, eh?’</p>

<p>Betsy trembled and whimpered, and did not
seem to have anything at all to say.</p>

<p>‘Now, stop all that noise,’ said Tor, with
that quiet authority in his tone which always
ensured instant obedience, ‘and answer me
truthfully, if you can. Are you and Mrs.
Belassis in league together?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, if you please, sir,’ answered Betsy
faintly.</p>

<p>‘And you have been her tool and spy ever
since you came here?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘What have you done for her so far, since
you came, besides letting her in these four
times to search the library?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>Betsy trembled still more, but felt compelled
to answer.</p>

<p>‘Please, sir, not much. I read a few letters,
and listened, when I could, to what went on.
My missis—I mean Mrs. Belassis—said as she
thought all wasn’t right, and bid me watch
and find out all I could; but it didn’t seem to
me there was much to do except to look for the
paper—what’s hidden away in the library.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you’re a nice honest young woman,
anyhow!’ remarked Tor, seeing that the girl
had not anything of much importance either
to tell or to conceal. ‘Now, you go straight
up to your room, and stay there till you have
leave to quit it. And pack up your things
ready to go back to your old mistress when
the right time comes; but if you dare to
disobey and leave before you have permission,
it will be the worse for you.’</p>

<p>And with that Tor strode back to his room,
and finished his night in peace.</p>

<p>In the morning, at the breakfast-table, he
told his story, which was listened to with
great excitement and interest.</p>

<p>‘You never let them go scot-free!’ cried
Miss Marjory. ‘Oh, Mr. Torwood, I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
better things of you! Why did you not confront
them at their task?’</p>

<p>‘Because I thought that, on the whole, it
would be better to confront them later on with
the will in my hand, and the information on
my lips, that it was to their nocturnal visits I
owed the clue which had enabled us to find it.
I thought that, on the whole, that would be the
most crushing way of doing it.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps!’ said Miss Marjory, still half-reluctantly;
‘but I never could have resisted
the temptation, if I had been there.’</p>

<p>‘And now the will will be found!’ cried
Phil, ‘and Maud will have her rights again.
Oh, if this isn’t just first-rate! Tor, you
rascal, why didn’t you summon me to confront
my virtuous aunt and uncle?’</p>

<p>‘I felt it was not safe to let them out of
my sight; and I’m not sure, in any case, if I
could have trusted your discretion.’</p>

<p>‘You see, he’s boss still, for all his protestations,’
said Phil to Miss Marjory. ‘I
always have to play second fiddle to him, in
reality.’</p>

<p>‘And a good thing too,’ answered Miss
Marjory, with emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine had listened with intense
interest to Tor’s account of what he had
overheard the Belassis’ say to one another.
When she really understood that the will—whose
existence had always been suspected—was
supposed to be hidden away in the
library at Ladywell, a little pink flush rose
in her cheeks, and she hastily left the room,
returning, however, in a few minutes with an
old-fashioned manuscript-book.</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ she began, half-timidly, half-eagerly,
‘I think I have something here which
may prove a clue. I have not thought of it
for many years; but perhaps there was a meaning
in it which I did not understand. I will
read you a little bit out of my diary, about the
death of your dear father, Philip. I think I
can understand better now what it was he
meant.’</p>

<p>Everyone listened with interest to the extract,
which Mrs. Lorraine proceeded to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘“My dear brother-in-law died this morning,
at nine o’clock. I was with him alone during
his last hours, for it was no place for young
children, and he could not endure Alfred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
Belassis near him, and became so painfully
excited if he even appeared, that we had to
forbid him the house.</p>

<p>‘“His mind, which had seemed much clouded
since the stroke, cleared somewhat, I fancied,
during the last hours of his life. He could
not speak, although he made great efforts to
do so; and he could not write, for his hand
was paralyzed. I hope I did not do wrong in
deceiving him; but he was so greatly distressed,
almost whilst he was dying, that I had
to pretend I had understood him.</p>

<p>‘“He struggled time after time to tell me
something, but he could only stutter and
stammer and make inarticulate sounds. I
could only make one word out of these stuttering
attempts, and that word was ‘Aristotle.’
Of course he must have been half-wandering,
or else I had quite misunderstood him. Just
at the last, he looked more despairing than
ever, and kept looking into my face so imploringly,
saying ‘Aristotle—Aristotle;’ and
not knowing what else to do, I said, ‘Yes,
yes, I quite understand—Aristotle—it will be
all right, dear Philip.’ And then he looked
so wonderfully relieved, and shut his eyes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
dropped into a kind of sleep, from which he
never woke.”’</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine ceased reading, and looked
round.</p>

<p>‘I never could understand how it was that
my saying those words could have comforted
him so, but it did. I have always kept his
Aristotle in remembrance of what he said; but
I never could make any sense of his words,
and thought I must quite have misunderstood
them. I fancied afterwards that what he
really wished to say was something about a
will he might have made, doing more justice
to Maud; but I never could see what Aristotle
could have to do with it.’</p>

<p>‘Come along!’ cried Phil eagerly, springing
up. ‘Let us all go and search for this
valuable document. Aristotle is our clue,
and before an hour is over, Maud shall have
her own again! Hurrah! <i>A bas</i> Belassis!
Won’t the old villain just curse and swear
when he finds that he has betrayed the hiding-place
himself!’</p>

<p>Maud’s eyes sparkled, more with excitement
at the idea of the Belassis overthrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
than at any special desire for an increase of
fortune. She seized Ethel by the hand, and
rushed after Phil; Mrs. Lorraine followed, and
Miss Marjory and Tor brought up the rear.</p>

<p>‘This will ruin Belassis if it is found,’ remarked
she, as they crossed the hall.</p>

<p>‘How so?’</p>

<p>‘Because he’s speculated with the trust-money,
and lost it. He told Lewis so—told
him he should be ruined if he insisted on
claiming it and handing it over to Maud, as
he wished to do.’</p>

<p>‘He’s a nice kind of guardian and executor!’
said Tor grimly. ‘Well, if this will is found,
he will have to abide by the consequences of
his own act.’</p>

<p>‘And serve him right, too!’ said Miss Marjory
briskly. ‘It is time punishment did
overtake him at last.’</p>

<p>Already the room had been reached, and
an eager search begun. Mr. Maynard’s
library was extensive, and not over-well
arranged; but all the authors were together,
and in a moment Aristotle was pounced upon,
and every volume of every edition was pulled
down from the shelves for inspection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>But after about five minutes of eager, rapid
search, a silence and slight consternation fell
upon the searchers, for it became evident that
there was no will hidden away in these
volumes.</p>

<p>‘It’s gone!’ cried Phil dismally, ‘or else it’s
in some of the other books. What a sell! I
thought we were safe to find it. Can anybody
else have been beforehand with us?’</p>

<p>‘Not likely,’ said Tor, ‘as the Belassis’ have
failed in their attempt. Bar accident, it ought
still to be here. Does anybody know if the
books have been left just as they were when
Mr. Maynard was alive?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; they have not been disturbed at all,’
said Mrs. Lorraine. ‘They are all in their
old places, as he kept them.’</p>

<p>‘That is well,’ said Tor, and strode across
to where the vacant space yawned, from which
the books had just been removed.</p>

<p>The rest crowded round him as he began a
careful examination of the woodwork behind
the shelves, tapping with his knuckles on
every inch of exposed wood.</p>

<p>‘There!’ cried Miss Marjory suddenly;
‘there’s a hollow there. Try again!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>Tor did so, and the doubt became a
certainty.</p>

<p>‘There’s a crack in the woodwork here, too,’
he said, scanning it eagerly. ‘A chisel and a
hammer, and we’ll see what we shall see!’</p>

<p>Maud darted off and quickly returned,
bringing the required implements.</p>

<p>A little dexterous manœuvring and a square
of wood fell forwards, disclosing to view a
cavity into which was inserted a paper, folded
square, so as just to fit the place made for its
reception.</p>

<p>‘Maud,’ said Tor, turning round, ‘you had
better take it out. I am convinced that it is
your father’s last will.’</p>

<p>Maud’s hand trembled a little as she did his
bidding. In perfect silence she drew the
paper out of its long-hidden place of concealment,
and looked at the superscription: ‘<i>To
my daughter, Maud Debenham</i>.’</p>

<p>‘You open it,’ she said, giving it to Tor.
‘I don’t feel as if I could.’</p>

<p>Tor obeyed. The envelope addressed to
Maud contained two documents; one was a
letter, the other a paper, which bore the important
words, ‘Last will and testament of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Philip Debenham,’ dated four months later
than the will which had been produced by
Belassis.</p>

<p>‘Read it, Tor,’ said Maud.</p>

<p>He obeyed. It was not a long will. It
merely, as before, left all the father’s property
to Philip and the mother’s to Maud—without
any condition whatever. Mr. Twyne,
the lawyer, and Mr. Maynard were appointed
executors, and Mr. Maynard was made guardian
to the children. Mr. Debenham seemed to
have a presentiment that his hale and hearty
old uncle would outlive him, as indeed had
been the case. He had had an idea that he
would die young, which also had verified itself.
No mention whatever was made in the will of
Belassis or of his son.</p>

<p>The letter to Maud was next read; it was
a very different production from the one Mr.
Belassis had brought forward.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
‘<span class="smcap">My dear Daughter</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>‘Four months ago I was induced by
your uncle to make a will most unjust towards
you, and towards your dear dead mother, my
beloved wife. Why I consented to do this and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
write the letter he dictated to me, need not now
be explained; suffice it to say that I yielded
to pressure (the nature of which you cannot
understand), because I knew that it was in my
power to reverse the condition which my pen
had imposed upon you and upon your future.</p>

<p>‘I have now reversed it. I have done you
justice; and it is possible that you may never
know the terms of the will which this one
will supersede.</p>

<p>‘My child, beware of your uncle, Alfred
Belassis. Do not trust him, do not give him
one particle of power over you; and above all,
try not to fear him. Blind trust, followed
by blind fear, has been the curse of my life.
I pray that you and Philip may be delivered
from a like curse.</p>

<p>‘This fear is still master of me, bitterly
though I scorn myself for it. This letter I
am now writing, and the will I have just
framed, must be hidden away from his sight,
or I may be induced to give way to him, and
do you irreparable harm. When I feel my
end approaching, then and only then shall I
reveal to some trusty friend the hiding-place
I have selected for these precious papers.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
<p>Then and only then will you learn how much
your father loved you, and how bitterly he
suffered for even seeming to consent to do you
so deep an injustice.</p>

<p>‘Farewell, my dear and only daughter;
think kindly and not scornfully of your weak
but unhappy father.</p>

<small>THE FALL OF BELASSIS.</small></h2>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">omebody</span> must see Belassis about
this, Phil,’ said Tor, when the
matter of the will had been discussed
many times over, in all its bearings.
‘Either you as Maud’s brother, or I as her
prospective husband. Which of us shall it be?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you,’ answered Phil quickly. ‘I
shouldn’t know what to say.’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ returned Tor. ‘I’ll go—and
the sooner he knows his fate, the better.’</p>

<p>‘It may be vindictive on my part,’ remarked
Miss Marjory, ‘but I must say that I feel a
savage satisfaction in picturing the overthrow
of Belassis.’</p>

<p>Maud laughed at her look and tone.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid he won’t be so very much overthrown,
Miss Marjory. You see, he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
quarrelled with Lewis, so he will not care so
very much which of us has the money.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps he wouldn’t, if there was any
money to have; but as he has lost it all, he
will care considerably. Lewis would hardly
have sued his own father and ruined him; but
your natural guardians, Maud, have no choice;
and your worthy uncle will be brought to his
bearings, as he richly deserves to be.’</p>

<p>Maud began to look grave; but Mrs. Lorraine’s
voice now took up the word.</p>

<p>‘Not quite ruined—for Celia has four hundred
a year settled upon her, which cannot be
touched. It will keep them from actual
poverty when the rest goes. I thought it a
little hard once,’ continued Aunt Olive, with
a smile; ‘for it was half what was to have
been my portion—only father cut me off, and
divided it between Maud and Celia, and settled
it upon them. I am glad now; for I should
not like Celia to be robbed of all by her bad
husband, and I am so well looked after now,
that I want for nothing myself.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m glad that it’s not absolute
ruin for them,’ said Tor, pulling at his
moustache. ‘Because the innocent always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
have to suffer with the guilty, and it would
fall hardly on his family, richly as he deserves
it all himself. Justice must be done, of course.
A trustee cannot be allowed to get off, after
simply robbing the legatee of her entire fortune;
but it would make it harder to execute
justice, if it meant absolute penury for the
whole family.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be soft, Torrington Torwood,’ said
Miss Marjory warningly; ‘remember that
Belassis made Maud’s father’s life a burden
to him, and robbed Phil of every vestige of his
inheritance. He is not worthy of your compassion.
If justice never overtook the wicked,
the world would come to an end faster than it
is doing already.’</p>

<p>So after luncheon Tor started for Thornton
House, with everybody’s consent that he
should make his own terms with Belassis.</p>

<p>Maud, of course, trusted him in everything,
and would be satisfied with whatever
arrangement he chose to make. Phil knew
his friend would manage matters much better
than he could do himself; and Mrs. Lorraine
always felt sure that the ‘first Phil,’ as she
often called him, could be trusted to be firm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
and just, and yet considerate and temperate,
with all with whom he came in contact.</p>

<p>Perhaps Tor did not altogether relish his
errand, although there was a certain satisfaction
in confronting the foe, with the winning
card in his hand. Nevertheless, he thought
the matter would be better managed by himself
than by Phil, who was likely to be too
yielding one moment, and too hard the next,
according as each side of the question came
uppermost.</p>

<p>Again he found Mr. and Mrs. Belassis alone
together in the study, and he fancied they
looked surprised and uneasy at his appearance.</p>

<p>He shook hands easily and pleasantly, for
in spite of their many attempts, he had never
allowed himself to be drawn into a quarrel,
and had always treated them with a cheerful
politeness, which even the hard words given
and received had never entirely overset.</p>

<p>‘I hope your late hours have not been too
much for you,’ he remarked with a smile, as
he took a chair opposite Mrs. Belassis. ‘It is
not all of us who can sit up till dawn, and not
feel the effects of it afterwards.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>Dead silence followed this speech. Mr. Belassis
began to grow purple. Mrs. Belassis
closed her lips tightly, and looked Tor full in
the face, with eyes which seemed as if they
would fain read his very soul.</p>

<p>Had Betsy Long betrayed her?</p>

<p>‘I do not know what you are talking about,
Mr. Torwood,’ she said at last.</p>

<p>‘No? I was alluding to your visit to
Ladywell last night; and hoping that your
late, or rather early hours, and a two miles
walk at the end of it, had not disagreed with
you.’</p>

<p>‘Ladywell!’ gasped Belassis, with his usual
insane attempt to escape from the inevitable.
‘I haven’t even been to Ladywell for
weeks!’</p>

<p>‘Then it must have been your double I
saw,’ answered Tor. ‘A double is a nasty
thing, Mr. Belassis, especially when it performs
such questionable actions as yours does—stealing
into people’s houses at the dead of
night, in order to find and destroy legal papers
of great value. I should try to rid myself of
such a Doppelgänger, if I were you, or you
may find it lead you into trouble some day.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>The colour had all faded from Mrs. Belassis’
face. She looked grey and ghastly.</p>

<p>‘Speak out!’ she said hoarsely. ‘Say at
once what it is you have come for.’</p>

<p>‘I have come to thank you for a very valuable
discovery which you have enabled us to
make.’</p>

<p>‘Discovery!’</p>

<p>‘Yes; the discovery of certain papers which,
but for you, would without doubt have mouldered
away, unknown and unsuspected, behind
the woodwork of the Ladywell library. Your
nocturnal attempts to discover these same
papers, and your certainty of their whereabouts,
enabled others with better opportunities
to make the discovery you failed to do;
but it is to you, and you only, that we owe the
clue. Without the information you gave us,
the papers would without doubt have remained
for generations in their hiding-place, which
has so well concealed them for eighteen years.’</p>

<p>‘Papers!’ gasped Belassis; ‘what papers?’</p>

<p>‘Betsy Long has betrayed us!’ exclaimed
his wife, in the same breath.</p>

<p>‘Not at all,’ answered Tor quietly. ‘Your
spy, whom you so cleverly and honourably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
manœuvred for me to take into my service,
has been loyal to you—more loyal than such
creatures generally are. I am surprised that
a clever woman like you, Mrs. Belassis, should
stoop to use so clumsy a tool. However, such
good service has been done us by all this, that
it is not for me to complain. Your spy, who
has been really your servant, not ours, is
coming back to you this afternoon. I wish
you joy of her, after the training you have
thought fit to bestow upon her. No, she has
not betrayed you; make yourself quite easy
on that score. You betrayed yourselves by
the sounds you made, and I had the pleasure
and profit of seeing and hearing a good deal
that passed in the library last night. It may
be a satisfaction to you to hear that the papers
you were so anxious about have now been
found; and you are welcome to see them for
yourselves any day you wish, by coming over
to Ladywell.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis was pale with rage and dismay,
her husband with abject fear.</p>

<p>‘What papers?’ he gasped again.</p>

<p>‘Philip Debenham’s last will and testament—the
one you were so certain he would frame,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
if he could, to cancel the one you wrung from
him by the extraordinary influence you had
obtained over him. It is all exactly as you
thought. He did make another will, and hid
it away at Ladywell, out of your reach. You
have betrayed your own secret, and thanks to
you, that will is now in our possession.’</p>

<p>Belassis could not speak. After a few
minutes’ pause his wife asked:</p>

<p>‘And what are its terms?’</p>

<p>‘Not any which <i>ought</i> to affect you—simply
that Maud inherits her mother’s fortune,
principal and interest, without any condition
whatever. You best know how this transfer
will affect you; as I said before, apart from
your paternal feeling for your son, the matter
should not make the smallest difference to
you.’</p>

<p>Belassis’ face was white and rigid.</p>

<p>‘It will only ruin me, that’s all.’</p>

<p>‘You mean to say that you have lost the
money?’ asked Tor coolly.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Then of course you will have to make
good the loss.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot—I have been very unlucky.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
I don’t know how to lay my hands upon five
thousand, let alone twenty, and it will come
to that and more, with compound interest for
all these years.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Mr. Belassis, you understand your
own affairs best, but you know the money
will have to be paid.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot pay it, I tell you!’</p>

<p>‘You should have considered all that before
you thought fit to speculate with it. Now
you have no alternative in the matter. You
chose to spend another person’s money, and
you must repay it. The whole thing is as
plain as a pikestaff.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t—I tell you I can’t!’</p>

<p>‘You will soon find that you are obliged.’</p>

<p>‘I say I can’t!’ cried Belassis, waxing
desperate. ‘You can’t get blood out of a
stone.’</p>

<p>‘No, but you can get money out of an
estate. You must sell your property, or
transfer it, in part payment. The thing is
perfectly simple.’</p>

<p>‘What!’ groaned Belassis, driven to bay;
‘do you mean to tell me that my own niece
would dare to turn me out of my house, to die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
like a dog upon the highroad, because I have
been so unfortunate as to lose some money,
which I was endeavouring to turn to good
account for her benefit? Do you mean to tell
me that?’</p>

<p>‘I mean to tell you,’ answered Tor, repressing
a strong inclination to punch the old
rascal’s head, ‘that the law will oblige you to
restore stolen property. You have squandered
away Maud’s inheritance in order to enrich
yourself, and now you will have to take the
consequences, and lose your own. You
cannot play fast and loose with other people’s
money and not suffer for it. You cannot have
your cake and eat your cake too. You chose
your own course of action, and now you must
abide by the results.’</p>

<p>‘My own niece would ruin me,’ moaned
Belassis, ‘whom I have reared like my own,
and treated as a daughter. I never thought
to see a day like this! I could not have
believed it possible. I will <i>not</i> believe dear
Maud means to be so cruel.’</p>

<p>‘Now, Mr. Belassis, I think we have had
enough of that,’ said Tor firmly, and the look
in his eye made Belassis quail and cease his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
lamentations. ‘You have been the worst
enemy the Debenhams have ever had or are
likely to have, and you know it as well as I.
You made the first Philip Debenham’s life
wretched by the mysterious power you obtained
over him; and you deprived his son of
all his inheritance; for you know as well as I,
that it was thanks to you that nothing remained
of the father’s property. You nearly
performed the same kind office for Maud; and
it is by a mere accident that this second great
wrong has not been successfully consummated.
And yet you think it well to bring forward
your claim of relationship, and hope to escape
your well-merited chastisement by throwing
yourself upon the mercy of the Debenhams!
What mercy do you think you deserve from
their hands?’</p>

<p>Belassis shrank into himself, and made no
attempt at a reply. It was his wife who spoke
first.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean to do?’</p>

<p>‘I have come here to ask what you mean
to do.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t do anything,’ groaned Belassis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>His wife gave him a look of withering
contempt, and Tor said quietly:</p>

<p>‘You will pretty soon find you have to do
something, Mr. Belassis. What is the value
of the property you own? You have about a
couple of hundred acres, and the farm, have
you not, and this house?’</p>

<p>‘I will never give up my property!’ cried
Belassis fiercely. ‘I will fight for it to the
death!’</p>

<p>‘Now look here, Mr. Belassis,’ said Tor, in
the voice which never failed to arrest attention,
‘I’ve not got an unlimited store of patience,
and if you exhaust it, you will find it all the
worse for yourself. You know you will have to
refund to Maud the money you chose to throw
away; you understand the law better than
I do, and I know that you are responsible
for its restoration. And if you force us to
appeal to the law, you will find yourself in a
much worse position than if you come to terms
quietly with us. There will be all the costs
to pay, and your name will be known throughout
the country as that of a dishonest trustee.
I am empowered to act for Maud, and if you
will arrange matters with me, you will find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
yourself fairly treated, and a due allowance
made for the value of your property; but if
you go too far, I shall simply decline to
negotiate with you, and you will be forced to
sell the property at what it will fetch, in order
to make good the lost money. In these days,
when land is a drug in the market, I leave you
to judge which course is most in accordance
with your own interests. It is a matter of no
importance to me.’</p>

<p>Belassis was silenced; he began to see once
again that the man before him was more than
his match.</p>

<p>‘What do you want me to do?’ he asked
sullenly enough.</p>

<p>‘The only thing left for you to do—hand
over the property to Maud, as payment or part payment
of what you owe.’</p>

<p>‘It is worth far more than the sum I owe.’</p>

<p>‘That remains to be proved. We must
have a valuation. We will each appoint an
agent, and abide by their united decision. No
doubt all that can be easily arranged later.
You will be fairly dealt by, Mr. Belassis. We
shall not do as we have been done by.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to insult me?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>‘Certainly not, unless the truth is an
insult. If so, whose fault is it?’</p>

<p>Belassis grew a dusky red. He dared not
answer Tor; but it was not pleasant to sit
under his eye and hear such remarks made.</p>

<p>‘And I suppose I shall have to go on the
parish,’ he remarked presently. ‘My virtuous
relatives will combine to drive me there.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you can settle that point with Mrs.
Belassis,’ answered Tor. ‘As, by a lucky
chance, you really did marry her, perhaps she
may consent to allow you to subsist upon her
private income, which will keep her in comfort.
If she does, you will get more than you deserve
at her hands; but that is a question with
which I have nothing to do. Mrs. Belassis,
no doubt, will tell you her views on it later.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked as if she meant to tell
her husband her views on a variety of subjects
as soon they were left in private, but all she
said was:</p>

<p>‘Have you finished the business upon which
you came, Mr. Torwood?’</p>

<p>He rose, not at all unwilling to take his
departure.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think you understand all that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
needful now. You can make your arrangements,
and communicate either with me direct,
or through Mr. Twyne, as you like best. If
you wish to see the late Philip Debenham’s
will you can do so. We will not hurry you
needlessly, but remember that we wish to
avoid unnecessary delays, which can only be a
vexation to both parties.’</p>

<p>And then Tor bowed himself out, feeling
that Mrs. Belassis would soon bring her husband
to sense and reason, and that he could
now, metaphorically speaking, wash his hands
of all further dealings with them.</p>

<p>He had not got very far from the house
before he met Maud, who had come out with
the intention of waylaying him.</p>

<p>‘Well, Tor,’ she said, ‘what has happened?
How did they take it?’</p>

<p>‘Pretty much as one might have expected—he
like a coward and a sneak, she like a
proud woman. She’s no favourite of mine,
Mrs. Belassis, but she has good pluck.’</p>

<p>‘And—and—is what Miss Marjory said
true? Will they be——’</p>

<p>‘Ruined? Well, not absolutely, because
Mrs. Belassis has property; but they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
have to sell their place; and I should think
they would prefer to retire from this part of
the country altogether.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, what a good thing!’ cried Maud, with
enthusiasm. ‘I never could bear to think of
living near Uncle and Aunt Belassis; and yet
I do so like Ladywell, and should not care to
go far away. You are going to live somewhere
near here when—when we’re married,
aren’t you, Tor?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, certainly; if you wish it, little sweetheart!
What should you say to Thornton
House?’</p>

<p>‘I <i>hate</i> Thornton House!’ cried Maud, with
energy and decision.</p>

<p>‘You mustn’t hate it, Maud; for it will
soon be your own property.’</p>

<p>‘Mine!’</p>

<p>‘Yes; it is the only way Belassis can pay
what he owes, by making over the property
to you. I knew you wanted a house near
Ladywell, and I have means to keep it up;
so, as it seemed the only way of getting the
money, it stands just as I have said.’</p>

<p>Maud’s face brightened, and she began to
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>‘It’s delightful to think of having a house
of our own, Tor; and it seems to bring things
so home to one, when it is really almost
settled; only—only—I did so hate Thornton
House when I lived there—I have always
hated it!’</p>

<p>‘It will not be Thornton House under us,
Maud; we will call it Ladywell Lodge. And
I’ll undertake that when the present occupants
have cleared out with all their belongings, and
my work-people have been all through the
house, decorating and furnishing, and when
Miss Marjory has laid out the gardens anew,
I’ll undertake then that you shall not know
the place again. Will that satisfy you?’</p>

<p>Maud looked up at him with dancing
eyes.</p>

<p>‘Of course it will! I should be satisfied
with anything in the world, if you had the
arranging of it!’</p>

<p>‘It could be made a very pretty place, I
have often thought, differently arranged both
inside and out. Mr. and Mrs. Belassis were
hardly people of taste; and their house and
garden show it. You and I, Maud, will
make it look very different.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh yes!’ cried Maud eagerly. ‘I’m sure
we can. And when it is once <i>our</i> house, and
Ladywell Lodge, it will never remind me
one bit of that horrid old Thornton House.
Oh, we shall be very, very happy! I can’t
understand sometimes how it is that I am so
happy, and that everything has come round so
delightfully! Suppose Phil had not had that
sunstroke, and you had not come over! Oh
dear! oh dear! I believe I should have been
Mrs. Lewis Belassis by this time!’</p>

<p>‘Horrid thought!’ laughed Tor, pressing
closer to him the little hand which lay upon
his arm. ‘You never seem to have borne
me any malice for the trick I played upon
you, Maud; and the unwarrantable liberties I
took.’</p>

<p>She looked up, smiling archly.</p>

<p>‘I hardly had time to get thoroughly angry
with you, before you came and surprised me
in the garden. I never had any chance of
showing how dignified I can be when I am
offended.’</p>

<p>‘You certainly never did show it. I think
I came off with flying colours all round. I
had always looked forward with some dread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
to facing you all, after the revelation was
made; but even that did not prove a very
trying ordeal!’</p>

<p>‘You bad boy!’ said Maud; ‘you took
care to get your own way with me, as you
do with everybody else. Why did you never
confide in me, Tor; and tell me the truth, when
you began to get uneasy about how things
would turn out? I think you might have
trusted me.’</p>

<p>‘So I did; but I felt it would make your
position a very trying one. Indeed, I think
it would have been worse for both of us.
And how could I tell how you would like to
hear of your brother’s helplessness, and see
another acting in his place? It might have
turned you against me!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Tor!’ said Maud; ‘you know you
don’t think that!’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘That I should ever have turned against
you?’</p>

<p>‘Why should you not?’</p>

<p>She looked up at him and shook her head
gravely.</p>

<p>‘You can’t guess, of course?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>‘I was never much of a hand at guessing.’</p>

<p>‘No? Well, then you had better remain
in ignorance.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to remain in ignorance. I
want you to tell me.’</p>

<p>‘As if you did not know!’</p>

<p>‘Tell me, I say.’</p>

<p>‘I’m not sure if I will.’</p>

<p>‘But I am—quite sure. Come, Maud; how
long am I to be kept waiting?’</p>

<p>‘You deserve to be kept all night, you
tyrant! but you always do manage to get
your own way. You know it is because—I
love you with my whole heart!’</p>

<p>And with that answer Tor seemed content.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">nd</span> so wrong was made right, and
justice overtook the evil-doer; and
in a very short time the Belassis
family had removed from Thornton House,
taking all their goods with them, and leaving
behind no pleasant regrets in the minds of
others, nor even the feeling that they would be
missed from the neighbourhood where they had
lived so long.</p>

<p>No, never popular with anyone, the name of
Belassis became opprobrious when the news of
his conduct was noised abroad. When once
the belief in his honesty had exploded, everybody
had some tale to tell of his hardness or
trickery or deceitfulness, and very heartily was
he abused in all quarters.</p>

<p>‘Serve him right! I hope he will feel it!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
said Miss Marjory, when she heard of it. ‘For
I always did say you let him off far too easily,
Mr. Torwood.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t hit a man when he’s down,’ answered
Tor. ‘I had too completely the whip-hand of
him to use it with much force.’</p>

<p>‘If I’d been in your place, I’d not have
spared him!’ cried the eager little gentlewoman.
‘I’d have scared him out of his
senses. He’s an old villain, and doesn’t deserve
anybody’s compassion.’</p>

<p>‘No, he doesn’t deserve any consideration at
all, I quite admit,’ returned Tor; ‘but the fact
is, he was such a pitiable and contemptible
object, that one didn’t care to waste words of
any kind over him. You’d have felt the same
if you’d been in my place, Miss Marjory. I
am quite sure you would.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well, perhaps so; but I shall always
say and think that Belassis got off much more
easily than he deserved—much more easily
than he would have done if I’d had the
handling of him.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Miss Marjory, console yourself with
the thought that his wife has had the handling
of him,’ answered Tor, with a smile. ‘I think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
if you had seen the look in her eye, you would
have been content. I felt that I couldn’t
leave him in better hands.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory laughed.</p>

<p>‘Ah yes, there’s something in that; but
then I ought to have the handling of <i>her</i>; for
she’s almost as bad as her husband, and it’s
more disgraceful in her than in him, for she
has good blood in her veins.’</p>

<p>‘I should think she will be punished enough
by the loss of position and wealth. She is a
proud woman, and it will be a bitter pill for
her to swallow, this sudden descent in the
social scale. Miss Marjory, I do really think
that you may make your mind easy about the
Belassis family. I think their sins will be
well punished.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I hope so, I’m sure; but I shall
always say you let them off too easily.’</p>

<p>Tor certainly behaved generously towards a
fallen foe, he and Maud together; but there
was no doubt as to which was the active agent
in all such matters.</p>

<p>The valuation of the estate fell considerably
short of the sum owed by Belassis to Maud;
but he was not hardly dealt with when it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
found that he was unable to make up the full
amount. A compromise was effected; and he
was even allowed to carry away into retirement
the furniture, plate, glass, and china
which belonged to Thornton House, and which
might fairly have been claimed as compensation.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was less generosity in this
than some people supposed, but Maud Debenham’s
magnanimity was greatly praised by
all in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Poor Matilda and Bertha Belassis were inconsolable,
and were certainly to be pitied.
They came up to Ladywell several times
during the ‘turn-out,’ and shed oceans of
salt tears, and quite distorted their rather
plain faces by the utter abandonment of their
grief.</p>

<p>‘Pity us, Maud! do pity us!’ they would
say. ‘Fancy, shut up in a horrid little poky
house—quite poor people we shall be—and
always <i>with mamma</i>!’ this seemed the climax
of horror, and Maud understood it only too
well.</p>

<p>It was a gleam of consolation when they
learnt that London was to be their destination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
and that their father intended going into
business of some kind, to re-establish his fallen
fortunes.</p>

<p>Maud made the best of this in her attempt
to comfort them.</p>

<p>‘You will like London ever so much: there
will be such lots to see, and such heaps of
people to make friends with; and when Tor
and I are in town, you shall come and see us,
and we will go shopping together, and to the
opera and the park and everywhere. I believe
you’ll get to like it so much, when once you’re
settled, that you would never care to come
back any more; and you’ll wonder how it
ever was that you were happy at Ladywell.’</p>

<p>Phil and Tor, in a good-natured way, tried
with Maud to comfort the distressed damsels:
and at the last they did go away somewhat
cheered. Lewis was living in London, and he
would probably be a well-to-do man in time;
and, altogether, the rising generation of the
Belassis family felt that there might be
brighter days in store for them yet.</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m glad they’ve gone away in better
spirits, poor things!’ said Maud, after the final
adieu, made the very day of the journey to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
London. ‘I am sorry for those two, because
it isn’t their fault; but somehow one can
never feel <i>interested</i> in Matilda and Bertha.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps they will find some one to be interested
in them in the great metropolis,’ suggested
Tor, smiling. ‘I hope, for their sakes,
that they will.’</p>

<p>Tor’s humane wish was presently realized;
and, before two years were over, Matilda and
Bertha had both found husbands, infinitely to
their own satisfaction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thornton House was at once re-named, and
Ladywell Lodge became a centre for the united
energy of architect, mason, and decorator.
Tor’s prediction, that the place would soon be
changed past recognition, was amply fulfilled;
and Ladywell Lodge became the envy and
admiration of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Not within, alone, did the transformation
scene take place. As soon as the season of
the year permitted it, down came Miss Marjory
from her northern home, and planting, transplanting,
turfing, and changes of all descriptions
went on as if by magic.</p>

<p>‘I can’t think how you know how to do it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
all, Miss Marjory,’ cried the delighted Maud,
when she came round to see what was going
on. ‘It’s not like the same place. It will be
perfectly lovely when the spring comes, and
the summer. I can’t think how you do it all—it’s
like magic!’</p>

<p>‘If I didn’t know how to lay out a garden
by this time, I should be a bright specimen,’
returned Miss Marjory, amused and pleased.
‘I mean Mr. Torwood to have the best laid-out
place in the county, because, my dear, I
am very fond of him; I always feel something
like a mother to him.’</p>

<p>Everyone agreed that Miss Marjory had
achieved her object before she left; and when
she did so, she carried off Maud to spend a
month with her at Whitbury.</p>

<p>Tor had a general invitation to come whenever
he pleased; and, to do justice to the
‘Torwood impudence,’ he was not shy in
availing himself of the privilege accorded to
him.</p>

<p>‘I believe he comes more to see you than
to see me, Miss Marjory,’ said Maud, one day.
‘I always tell him I am awfully jealous of
you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>With the twinkle in her eye, which all
who knew her liked to see, Miss Marjory
answered:</p>

<p>‘Well, my dear, of course when he begins
comparing you and me, it is impossible not to
be aware beforehand at what conclusion he
will be bound to arrive.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Phil was married at the beginning of the
new year. He and Roma made, as Miss
Marjory said, a very handsome, but not a very
interesting couple. They were absolutely
absorbed in one another, which was very right
and proper; but such people are not exciting
company, and it was considered an advantage
when they were safely started off for Italy, to
spend their honeymoon.</p>

<p>Ten days later, when the bridal couple were,
no one knew where, Michael Meredith was
found dead in his bed one morning; and the
funeral had to take place before it was possible
for Phil and Roma to get back.</p>

<p>Tor wrote to his friend, strongly advising
him to keep Roma abroad for many months,
until the shock and her first grief had worn
themselves out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>This he did with very successful results,
and Miss Marjory was bold enough to put
into words what everybody else really
thought.</p>

<p>‘Poor old man, it is well he is taken. He
was a dreadful burden upon that poor girl,
although she did not know it; and his sublime
selfishness would have been a great trial to
her and to Philip in their married life, and
would have raised continual complications and
difficulties. It is really a great mercy things
have turned out as they have; and Roma will
be a different being as Philip’s wife, from what
she has been as Meredith’s daughter.’</p>

<p>The letters which reached Maud from Roma
at frequent intervals, as well as those from Phil
to Tor, all seemed to point to the fact that Miss
Marjory’s conclusion had been a correct one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In June, Maud and Tor were married. They
had seen each other so constantly that the
rather long waiting had passed quickly. Tor
was anxious that Ladywell Lodge should
be in perfect order before he brought his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
young bride home to it; and it takes a long
time to get a place to the state of perfection
desired by an exacting man.</p>

<p>But at last all was ready. Mr. and Mrs.
Debenham had returned, and a grand wedding
from Ladywell took place, which made the
excitement and talk of the place for weeks.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory was there, of course, in all
her glory, and her present, the wedding-veil,
was a marvel of antique workmanship, and
almost overawed Maud by its beauty and
costliness.</p>

<p>She tried hard to persuade her ‘fairy godmother’
to be first bridesmaid, but this wish
was laughed to scorn.</p>

<p>‘It’s all very well for you to laugh; but I
tell you there is more truth in old-fashioned
sayings than you young people believe.
“Three times a bridesmaid, never a bride.”
I’ve been bridesmaid twice in my life before,
and do you think I’m going to throw away
my chance of a husband on a slip of a girl
like you?’</p>

<p>The wedding, however, was a brilliant success,
owing, as everybody said, a great deal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
its brightness to Miss Marjory’s unceasing
energy and unfailing flow of spirits.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom only spent a
short three weeks in Switzerland, and then returned
to England, and settled down in blissful
tranquillity at Ladywell Lodge.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine remained an inmate of the
Manor House, where her gentle yet practical
presence was of great value to the young
Squire and his artist-wife, and where she
was greatly beloved by all. She visited her
favourite, Maud, almost daily, and would sometimes
say, with tears of feeling in her eyes,
that it was quite a picture and a poem to see
how happy were both the children of Philip
Debenham.</p>

<p>Certainly life seemed to flow very smoothly
at Ladywell now; and the days fled by, they
hardly knew how. Upon most fine evenings
four people might be seen pacing the terrace
or the gardens of the Manor House; Roma
and Maud deep in talk, Phil and Tor arm-in-arm,
sometimes talking, always smoking, ever
seeming sublimely contented with themselves
and their surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>‘This is a fine realization of all our wildest
dreams—eh, Phil?’ Tor would sometimes say.
‘We’ve seen some odd passages in life, you
and I; but this is a famous wind-up to it
all.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; and a much better one than it ever
could have been, if you had not spent three
months of your life as Philip Debenham.’</p>

<p>Then Tor would grin with that sense of the
ridiculous which recollections of this episode
always brought.</p>

<p>‘Ah! what a time I had of it, what with
one thing, and what with another! I’m glad
enough I did it now; but you’ll never catch
me playing that game a second time, not for
anyone. My recollections of some of the
situations are far too vivid!’</p>

<p>‘And what an ass I was!’ Phil would say,
with a fervour that showed how genuine was
the sentiment. ‘Just to think I could ever
have been such a fool as to believe you wished
to supplant me! Just to think the bother
and worry and pain I gave myself believing
you to be an arch-traitor and deceiver—you,
mine own familiar friend!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Four years have come and gone since then,
and Ladywell Lodge is still as happy a home
as ever. There is a tiny baby Phil there now,
reigning supreme over all, save only the big
‘papa’ he adores and tries to tyrannize over
with all his small might. There is, too, a
prattling, laughing little Marjory, as self-willed
and imperious as the ‘godmother’ she is continually
chattering about, and who seems to
hold a very high place in her infant estimation.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory’s visits to Ladywell are a
source of increasing delight and satisfaction to
everybody in the place, only to be rivalled in
felicity by the annual excursion of the Torwood
family to the Minster House, Whitbury, where
a delightful fortnight is spent year by year,
in the height of the summer.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory is as strong and bright and
imperious as ever, and quite as fully convinced
that the world is rapidly coming to an
end, which theory is much strengthened by
the precocious utterances of her god-daughter.
People say that she grows younger instead of
older, and they also say that the new orchidhouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
which her landlord has built for
her, is one of the finest in the kingdom, and
has a great deal to do with her never-failing
health and happiness.</p>

notice some few years ago, in which
a man, having sustained injury to
the head, by the combined effects of
a sunstroke and a fall, remained in a helpless
and torpid state for above three months, and
then suddenly made a steady recovery. Except
for the length of time the state of torpor
lasted, there is nothing, to members of the

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
